### **Key Features**:
-**Multidisciplinary Approach**: Combines cryptography, psychology and political science.  
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples (from ATM hacking to nuclear systems).  
- **Provocative Insights**: Debunks myths (for example, about the reliability of PKI).  

**Example of a practical assignment**:  
> *"Analyze the vulnerability in TLS 1.2 (for example, FREAK) and write a PoC exploit in Python"*.  

To **enhance your course** add:  
1. **War Games**: Simulate an attack on the bank's infrastructure (using Chapters 8-9).
2. **Ethical Dilemmas**: Debates on topics like "Backdoors in Crypto Algorithms".
