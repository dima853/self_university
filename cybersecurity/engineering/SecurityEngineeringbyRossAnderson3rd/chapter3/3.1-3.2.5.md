## 3.1 Introduction ✨

Many real attacks exploit psychology at least as much as technology. We saw in the last chapter how some online crimes involve the manipulation of angry mobs, while both property crimes and espionage make heavy use of **phishing**, in which victims are lured by an email to log on to a website that appears genuine but that's actually designed to steal their passwords or get them to install malware.

Online frauds like phishing are often easier to do, and harder to stop, than similar real-world frauds because many online protection mechanisms are neither as easy to use nor as difficult to forge as their real-world equivalents. **It is much easier for crooks to create a bogus bank website that passes casual inspection than to build an actual bogus bank branch in a shopping street.**

We've evolved social and psychological tools over millions of years to help us deal with deception in face-to-face contexts, but these are less effective when we get an email that asks us to do something. For an ideal technology, **good use should be easier than bad use**. We have many examples in the physical world: a potato peeler is easier to use for peeling potatoes than a knife is, but **a lot harder** to use for murder. But we haven't always got this right for computer systems yet.

Much of the asymmetry between good and bad on which we rely in our daily business doesn't just depend on formal exchanges– which can be automated easily– but on some combination of physical objects, judgment of people, and the supporting social protocols. So, as our relationships with employers, banks and government become more formalised via online communication, and we lose both physical and human context, the forgery of these communications becomes more of a risk.

**Deception, of various kinds, is now the principal mechanism used to defeat online security.** It can be used to get passwords, to compromise confidential information or to manipulate financial transactions directly. Hoaxes and frauds have always happened, but the Internet makes some of them easier, and lets others be repackaged in ways that may bypass our existing controls (be they personal intuitions, company procedures or even laws).

Another driver for the surge in attacks based on social engineering is that **people are getting better at technology.** As designers learn how to forestall the easier technical attacks, psychological manipulation of system users or operators becomes ever more attractive. Therefore, **the security engineer absolutely must understand basic psychology**, as a prerequisite for dealing competently with everything from passwords to CAPTCHAs and from phishing to social engineering in general; a working appreciation of risk misperception and scaremongering is also necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying angry online mobs and the societal response to emergencies from terrorism to pandemic disease. So just as research in security economics led to a real shift in perspective between the first and second editions of this book, research in security psychology has made much of the difference to how we view the world between the second edition and this one.

In the rest of this chapter, I'll first survey relevant research in psychology, then work through how we apply the principles to make password authentication mechanisms more robust against attack, to security usability more generally, and beyond that to good design.

## 3.2 Insights from Psychology Research 🧩

Psychology is a huge subject, ranging from neuroscience through to clinical topics, and spilling over into cognate disciplines from philosophy through artificial intelligence to sociology. Although it has been studied for much longer than computer science, our understanding of the mind is much less complete: **the brain is so much more complex.** There is one central problem– the nature of consciousness– that we just don't understand at all. We know that 'the mind is what the brain does', yet the mechanisms that underlie our sense of self and of personal history remain obscure.

Nonetheless, **a huge amount is known about the functioning of the mind and the brain**, and we're learning interesting new things all the time. In what follows I can only offer a helicopter tour of three of the themes in psychology research that are very relevant to our trade:
1.  **Cognitive psychology**, which studies topics such as how we remember and what sort of mistakes we make.
2.  **Social psychology**, which deals with how we relate to others in groups and to authority.
3.  **Behavioral economics**, which studies the heuristics and biases that lead us to make decisions that are consistently irrational in measurable and exploitable ways.

---

### 3.2.1 Cognitive Psychology 🧠

Cognitive psychology is the classical approach to the subject– building on early empirical work in the nineteenth century. It deals with how we think, remember, make decisions and even daydream. Twentieth-century pioneers such as Ulric Neisser discovered that **human memory doesn't work like a video recorder**: our memories are stored in networks across the brain, from which they are reconstructed, so they change over time and can be manipulated [1429]. There are many well-known results. For example, **it is easier to memorise things that are repeated frequently, and it's easier to store things in context.** Many of these insights are used by marketers and scammers, but misunderstood or just ignored by most system developers.

**For example, EXAMPLE IN C:**
```c
// Bad design: too many menu items for short-term memory
void show_main_menu() {
    printf("1. Option Alpha\n");
    printf("2. Option Beta\n");
    printf("3. Option Gamma\n");
    printf("4. Option Delta\n");
    printf("5. Option Epsilon\n");
    printf("6. Option Zeta\n");
    printf("7. Option Eta\n");
    printf("8. Option Theta\n");
    printf("9. Option Iota\n"); // >7 items - already hard to remember
}
// Better design: grouping by meaning or nested menus
void show_improved_menu() {
    printf("=== File Operations ===\n");
    printf("1. New\n2. Open\n3. Save\n");
    printf("=== Edit Operations ===\n");
    printf("4. Copy\n5. Paste\n6. Cut\n");
}
```

For example, most of us have heard of George Miller's result that human short-term memory can cope with about **seven (plus or minus two) simultaneous choices** [1319] and, as a result, many designers limit menu choices to about five. But this is not the right conclusion. People search for information first by recalling where to look, and then by scanning; once you've found the relevant menu, scanning ten items is only twice as hard as scanning five. The real limits on menu size are screen size, which might give you ten choices, and with spoken menus, where the average user has difficulty dealing with more than three or four [1547]. Here, too, Miller's insight is misused because **spatio-structural memory is a different faculty from echoic memory.** This illustrates why a broad idea like 7+/-2 can be hazardous; you need to look at the detail.

In recent years, the centre of gravity in this field has been shifting from applied cognitive psychology to the **human-computer interaction (HCI)** research community, because of the huge amount of empirical know-how gained not just from lab experiments, but from the iterative improvement of fielded systems. As a result, HCI researchers not only model and measure human performance, including perception, motor control, memory and problem-solving; they have also developed an understanding of how users' **mental models** of systems work, how they differ from developers' mental models, and of the techniques (such as task analysis and cognitive walkthrough) that we can use to explore how people learn to use and understand systems.

Security researchers need to find ways of turning these ploughshares into swords (the bad guys are already working on it). There are some low-hanging fruit; for example, the safety research community has put a lot of effort into studying the errors people make when operating equipment [1592]. It is said that 'to err is human' and error research confirms this: the predictable varieties of human error are rooted in the very nature of cognition. The schemata, or mental models, that enable us to recognise people, sounds and concepts so much better than computers, also make us vulnerable when the wrong model gets activated.

**Human errors made while operating equipment fall into broadly three categories** depending on where they occur in the 'stack':
*   **Slips and lapses** at the level of skill.
*   **Mistakes** at the level of rules.
*   **Misconceptions** at the cognitive level.

1.  **Actions performed often become a matter of skill**, but we can slip when a manual skill fails– for example, pressing the wrong button– and we can also have a lapse where we use the wrong skill. For example, when you intend to go to the supermarket on the way home from work you may take the road home by mistake, if that's what you do most days (this is also known as a **capture error**). Slips are exploited by **typosquatters**, who register domains similar to popular ones, and harvest people who make typing errors; other attacks exploit the fact that people are trained to click 'OK' to pop-up boxes to get their work done. So when designing a system you need to ensure that dangerous actions, such as installing software, require action sequences that are quite different from routine ones. Errors also commonly follow interruptions and perceptual confusion. One example is the **post-completion error**: once they've accomplished their immediate goal, people are easily distracted from tidying-up actions. More people leave cards behind in ATMs that give them the money first and the card back second.

    **REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE:** You finish an online purchase, pay by card, and the site shows "Thank you for your purchase!". You close the tab but forget to log out of your account on the public computer. This is a post-completion error.

2.  **Actions that people take by following rules** are open to errors when they follow the wrong rule. Various circumstances– such as information overload– can cause people to follow the strongest rule they know, or the most general rule, rather than the best one. Phishermen use many tricks to get people to follow the wrong rule, ranging from using `https` (because 'it's secure') to starting URLs with the impersonated bank's name, as `www.citibank.secureauthentication.com`– for most people, looking for a name is a stronger rule than parsing its position.

3.  **The third category of mistakes** are those made by people for cognitive reasons– either they simply don't understand the problem, or pretend that they do, and ignore advice in order to get their work done. The seminal paper on security usability, Alma Whitten and Doug Tygar's "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt", demonstrated that the encryption program PGP was simply too hard for most college students to use as they didn't understand the subtleties of private versus public keys, encryption and signatures [2022]. And there's growing realisation that many security bugs occur because most programmers can't use security mechanisms either. Both access control mechanisms and security APIs are hard to understand and fiddly to use; security testing tools are often not much better. Programs often appear to work even when protection mechanisms are used in quite mistaken ways. Engineers then copy code from each other, and from online code-sharing sites, so misconceptions and errors are propagated widely [11]. They often know this is bad, but there's just not the time to do better.

There is some important science behind all this, and here are just two examples. James Gibson developed the concept of **action possibilities or affordances**: the physical environment may be climbable or fall-off-able or get-under-able for an animal, and similarly a seat is sit-on-able. People have developed great skill at creating environments that induce others to behave in certain ways: we build stairways and doorways, we make objects portable or graspable; we make pens and swords [763]. Often perceptions are made up of affordances, which can be more fundamental than value or meaning. In exactly the same way, we design software artefacts to train and condition our users' choices, so the affordances of the systems we use can affect how we think in all sorts of ways. We can also design traps for the unwary: an animal that mistakes a pitfall for solid ground is in trouble.

Gibson also came up with the idea of **optical flows**, further developed by Christopher Longuet-Higgins [1187]. As our eyes move relative to the environment, the resulting optical flow field lets us interpret the image, understanding the size, distance and motion of objects in it. There is an elegant mathematical theory of optical parallax, but our eyes deal with it differently: they contain receptors for specific aspects of this flow field which assume that objects in it are rigid, which then enables us to resolve rotational and translational components. Optical flows enable us to understand the shapes of objects around us, independently of binocular vision. We use them for some critical tasks such as landing an aeroplane and driving a car.

**In short, cognitive science gives useful insights into how to design system interfaces so as to make certain courses of action easy, hard or impossible.** It is increasingly tied up with research into computer human interaction. You can make mistakes more or less likely by making them easy or difficult; in section 28.2.2 I give real examples of usability failures causing serious accidents involving both medical devices and aircraft. Yet security can be even harder than safety if we have a sentient attacker who can provoke exploitable errors.

What can the defender expect attackers to do? They will use errors whose effect is predictable, such as capture errors; they will exploit perverse affordances; they will disrupt the flows on which safe operation relies; and they will look for, or create, exploitable dissonances between users' mental models of a system and its actual logic. To look for these, you should try a **cognitive walkthrough** aimed at identifying attack points, just as a code walkthough can be used to search for software vulnerabilities. Attackers also learn by experiment and share techniques with each other, and develop tools to look efficiently for known attacks. So it's important to be aware of the attacks that have already worked. (That's one of the functions of this book.)

### 3.2.2 Gender, Diversity and Interpersonal Variation 👫

Many women die because medical tests and technology assume that patients are men, or because engineers use male crash-test dummies when designing cars; protective equipment, from sportswear through stab-vests to spacesuits, gets tailored for men by default [498]. So do we have problems with information systems too? They are designed by men, and young geeky men at that, yet over half their users may be women. This realisation has led to research on **gender HCI**– on how software should be designed so that women can also use it effectively. Early experiments started from the study of behaviour: experiments showed that women use peripheral vision more, and it duly turned out that larger displays reduce gender bias. Work on American female programmers suggested that they tinker less than males, but more effectively [203]. But how much is nature, and how much nurture? Societal factors matter, and US women who program appear to be more thoughtful, but lower self-esteem and higher risk-aversion leads them to use fewer features.

Gender has become a controversial topic in psychology research. In the early 2000s, discussion of male aptitude for computer science was sometimes in terms of an analysis by Simon Baron-Cohen which gives people separate scores as **systemisers** (good at geometry and some kinds of symbolic reasoning) and as **empathisers** (good at intuiting the emotions of others and social intelligence generally) [177]. Most men score higher at systematising, while most women do better at empathising. The correspondence isn't exact; a minority of men are better at empathising while a minority of women are better at systematising. Baron-Cohen's research is in Asperger's and autism spectrum disorder, which he sees as an extreme form of male brain. This theory gained some traction among geeks who saw an explanation of why we're often introverted with more aptitude for understanding things than for understanding people. If we're born that way, it's not our fault. It also suggests an explanation for why geek couples often have kids on the spectrum.

Might this explain why men are more interested in computer science than women, with women consistently taking about a sixth of CS places in the USA and the UK? But here, we run into trouble. Women make up a third of CS students in the former communist countries of Poland, Romania and the Baltic states, while numbers in India are close to equal. Male dominance of software is also a fairly recent phenomenon. When I started out in the 1970s, there were almost as many women programmers as men, and many of the pioneers were women, whether in industry, academia or government. This suggests that the relevant differences are more cultural than genetic or developmental. The argument for a 'male brain / female brain' explanation has been progressively undermined by work such as that of Daphna Joel and colleagues who've shown by extensive neuroimaging studies that while there are recognisable male and female features in brains, the brains of individuals are a mosaic of both [987]. And although these features are visible in imaging, that does not mean they're all laid down at birth: our brains have a lot of **plasticity**. As with our muscles the tissues we exercise grow bigger. Perhaps nothing else might have been expected given the variance in gender identity, sexual preference, aggression, empathy and so on that we see all around us.

Other work has shown that gender performance differences are absent in newborns, and appear round about age 6–7, by which time children have long learned to distinguish gender and adapt to the social cues all around them, which are reinforced in developed countries by a tsunami of blue/pink gendered toys and marketing. (Some believe that women are happier to work in computing in India because India escaped the home computer boom in the 1980s and its evolution into gaming.) This is reinforced in later childhood and adolescence by gender stereotypes that they internalise as part of their identity; in cultures where girls aren't supposed to be good at maths or interested in computers, praise for being 'good at maths' can evoke a **stereotype threat** (the fear of confirming a negative stereotype about a group to which one belongs). Perhaps as a result, men react better to personal praise ('That was really clever of you!') while women are motivated better by performance praise ('You must have put in a hell of a lot of effort'). So it may not be surprising that we see a deficit of women in disciplines that praise genius, such as mathematics. What's more, similar mechanisms appear to underlie the poorer academic performance of ethnic groups who have been stigmatised as non-academic. In short, people are not just born different; **we learn to be different**, shaped by power, by cultural attitudes, by expectations and by opportunities. There are several layers between gene and culture with emergent behaviour, including the cell and the circuit. So if we want more effective interventions in the pipeline from school through university to professional development, we need a better understanding of the underlying neurological and cultural mechanisms. For a survey of this, see Gina Rippon [1608].

**Gender matters at many levels of the stack**, from what a product should do through how it does it. For example, should a car be faster or safer? This is entangled with social values. Are men better drivers because they win car races, or are women better drivers because they have fewer insurance claims? Digging down, we find gendered and cultural attitudes to risk. In US surveys, risks are judged lower by white people and by men, and on closer study this is because about 30% of white males judge risks to be extremely low. This bias is consistent across a wide range of hazards but is particularly strong for handguns, second-hand cigarette smoke, multiple sexual partners and street drugs. Asian males show similarly low sensitivity to some hazards, such as motor vehicles. White males are more trusting of technology, and less of government [693].

We engineers must of course work with the world as it is, not as it might be if our education system and indeed our culture had less bias; but we must be alert to the possibility that computer systems discriminate because they are built by men for men, just like cars and spacesuits. For example, Tyler Moore and I did an experiment to see whether anti-phishing advice given by banks to their customers was easier for men to follow than women, and we found that indeed it was [1339]. No-one seems to have done much work on gender and security usability, so there's an opportunity.

But the problem is much wider. Many systems will continue to be designed by young, fit, straight, clever men who are white or Asian and may not think hard or at all about the various forms of prejudice and disability that they do not encounter directly. You need to think hard about how you mitigate the effects. It's not enough to just have your new product tested by a token geek girl on your development team; you have to think also of the less educated and the vulnerable– including older people, children and women fleeing abusive relationships (about which I'll have more to say later). You really have to think of the **whole stack**. **Diversity matters** in corporate governance, market research, product design, software development and testing. If you can't fix the imbalance in dev, you'd better make it up elsewhere. You need to understand your users; it's also good to understand how power and culture feed the imbalance.

As many of the factors relevant to group behaviour are of social origin, we next turn to social psychology.

### 3.2.3 Social Psychology 👥

This attempts to explain how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviour of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. It has many aspects, from the identity that people derive from belonging to groups– whether of gender, tribe, team, profession or even religion– through the self-esteem we get by comparing ourselves with others. The results that put it on the map were three early papers that laid the groundwork for understanding the abuse of authority and its relevance to propaganda, interrogation and aggression. They were closely followed by work on the bystander effect which is also highly relevant to crime and security.

#### 3.2.3.1 Authority and its Abuse 👮

In 1951, Solomon Asch showed that people could be induced to deny the evidence of their own eyes in order to conform to a group. Subjects judged the lengths of lines after hearing wrong opinions from other group members, who were actually the experimenter's stooges. Most subjects gave in and conformed, with only 29% resisting the bogus majority [136].

Stanley Milgram was inspired by the 1961 trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann to investigate how many experimental subjects were prepared to administer severe electric shocks to an actor playing the role of a 'learner' at the behest of an experimenter while the subject played the role of the 'teacher'– even when the 'learner' appeared to be in severe pain and begged the subject to stop. This experiment was designed to measure what proportion of people will obey an authority rather than their conscience. Most did– Milgram found that consistently over 60% of subjects would do downright immoral things if they were told to [1314]. This experiment is now controversial but had real influence on the development of the subject.

The third was the Stanford Prisoner Experiment which showed that normal people can behave wickedly even in the absence of orders. In 1971, experimenter Philip Zimbardo set up a 'prison' at Stanford where 24 students were assigned at random to the roles of 12 warders and 12 inmates. The aim of the experiment was to discover whether prison abuses occurred because warders (and possibly prisoners) were self-selecting. However, the students playing the role of warders rapidly became sadistic authoritarians, and the experiment was halted after six days on ethical grounds [2076]. This experiment is also controversial now and it's unlikely that a repeat would get ethical approval today. But **abuse of authority**, whether real or ostensible, is a real issue if you are designing operational security measures for a business.

During the period 1995–2005, a telephone hoaxer calling himself 'Officer Scott' ordered the managers of over 68 US stores and restaurants in 32 US states (including at least 17 McDonald's stores) to detain some young employee on suspicion of theft and strip-search them. Various other degradations were ordered, including beatings and sexual assaults [2036]. A former prison guard was tried for impersonating a police officer but acquitted. At least 13 people who obeyed the caller and did searches were charged with crimes, and seven were convicted. McDonald's got sued for not training its store managers properly, even years after the pattern of hoax calls was established; and in October 2007, a jury ordered them to pay $6.1 million dollars to one of the victims, who had been strip-searched when she was an 18-year-old employee. It was a nasty case, as she was left by the store manager in the custody of her boyfriend, who then committed a further indecent assault on her. The boyfriend got five years, and the manager pleaded guilty to unlawfully detaining her. McDonald's argued that she was responsible for whatever damages she suffered for not realizing it was a hoax, and that the store manager had failed to apply common sense. A Kentucky jury didn't buy this and ordered McDonald's to pay up. The store manager also sued, claiming to be another victim of the firm's negligence to warn her of the hoax, and got $1.1 million [1090]. So US employers now risk heavy damages if they fail to train their staff to resist the abuse of authority.

#### 3.2.3.2 The Bystander Effect 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️

On March 13, 1964, a young lady called Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death in the street outside her apartment in Queens, New York. The press reported that thirty-eight separate witnesses had failed to help or even to call the police, although the assault lasted almost half an hour. Although these reports were later found to be exaggerated, the crime led to the nationwide 911 emergency number, and also to research on why bystanders often don't get involved.

John Darley and Bibb Latané reported experiments in 1968 on what factors modulated the probability of a bystander helping someone who appeared to be having an epileptic fit. They found that a lone bystander would help 85% of the time, while someone who thought that four other people could see the victim would help only 31% of the time; group size dominated all other effects. Whether another bystander was male, female or even medically qualified made essentially no difference [513]. **The diffusion of responsibility** has visible effects in many other contexts. If you want something done, you'll email one person to ask, not three people. Of course, security is usually seen as something that other people deal with.

However, if you ever find yourself in danger, the real question is whether at least one of the bystanders will help, and here the recent research is much more positive. Lasse Liebst, Mark Levine and others have surveyed CCTV footage of a number of public conflicts in several countries over the last ten years, finding that in 9 out of 10 cases, one or more bystanders intervened to de-escalate a fight, and that the more bystanders intervene, the more successful they are [1166]. So it would be wrong to assume that bystanders generally pass by on the other side; so the bystander effect's name is rather misleading.

### 3.2.4 The Social-Brain Theory of Deception 🎭

Our second big theme, which also fits into social psychology, is the growing body of research into deception. How does deception work, how can we detect and measure it, and how can we deter it?

The modern approach started in 1976 with the **social intelligence hypothesis**. Until then, anthropologists had assumed that we evolved larger brains in order to make better tools. But the archaeological evidence doesn't support this. All through the paleolithic period, while our brains evolved from chimp size to human size, we used the same simple stone axes. They only became more sophisticated in the neolithic period, by which time our ancestors were anatomically modern homo sapiens. So why, asked Nick Humphrey, did we evolve large brains if we didn't need them yet? Inspired by observing the behaviour of both caged and wild primates, his hypothesis was that **the primary function of the intellect was social**. Our ancestors didn't evolve bigger brains to make better tools, but to use other primates better as tools [936]. This is now supported by a growing body of evidence, and has transformed psychology as a discipline. Social psychology had been a poor country cousin until then and was not seen as rigorous; since then, people have realised it was probably the driving force of cognitive evolution. Almost all intelligent species developed in a social context. (One exception is the octopus, but even it has to understand how predators and prey react.)

The primatologist Andy Whiten then collected much of the early evidence on tactical deception, and recast social intelligence as the **Machiavellian brain hypothesis**: we became smart in order to deceive others, and to detect deception too [362]. Not everyone agrees completely with this characterisation, as the positive aspects of socialisation, such as empathy, also matter. But Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have recently collected masses of evidence that the modern human brain is more a machine for arguing than anything else [1296]. Our goal is **persuasion** rather than truth; rhetoric comes first, and logic second.

The second thread coming from the social intellect hypothesis is **theory of mind**, an idea due to David Premack and Guy Woodruff in 1978 but developed by Heinz Wimmer and Josef Perner in a classic 1983 experiment to determine when children are first able to tell that someone has been deceived [2032]. In this experiment, the Sally-Anne test, a child sees a sweet hidden under a cup by Sally while Anne and the child watch. Anne then leaves the room and Sally switches the sweet to be under a different cup. Anne then comes back and the child is asked where Anne thinks the sweet is. Normal children get the right answer from about age five; this is when they acquire the ability to discern others' beliefs and intentions. Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan Leslie and Uta Frith then showed that children on the Aspergers / autism spectrum acquire this ability significantly later [178].

Many computer scientists and engineers appear to be on the spectrum to some extent, and we're generally not as good at deception as neurotypical people are. This has all sorts of implications! We're under-represented in politics, among senior executives and in marketing. Oh, and there was a lot less cybercrime before underground markets brought together geeks who could write wicked code with criminals who could use it for wicked purposes. Geeks are also more likely to be whistleblowers; we're less likely to keep quiet about an uncomfortable truth just to please others, as we place less value on their opinions. But this is a complex field. Some well-known online miscreants who are on the spectrum were hapless more than anything else; Gary McKinnon claimed to have hacked the Pentagon to discover the truth about flying saucers and didn't anticipate the ferocity of the FBI's response. And other kinds of empathic deficit are involved in many crimes. Other people with dispositional empathy deficits include psychopaths who disregard the feelings of others but understand them well enough to manipulate them, while there are many people whose deficits are situational, ranging from Nigerian scammers who think that any white person who falls for their lure must think Africans are stupid, so they deserve it, right through to soldiers and terrorists who consider their opponents to be less than human or to be morally deserving of death. I'll discuss radicalisation in more detail later in section 26.4.2.

The third thread is **self-deception**. Robert Trivers argues that we've evolved the ability to deceive ourselves in order to better deceive others: "If deceit is fundamental in animal communication, then there must be strong selection to spot deception and this ought, in turn, to select for a degree of self-deception, rendering some facts and motives unconscious so as to not betray– by the subtle signs of self-knowledge– the deception being practiced" [906]. We forget inconvenient truths and rationalise things we want to believe. There may well be a range of self-deception abilities from honest geeks through to the great salesmen who have a magic ability to believe completely in their product. But it's controversial, and at a number of levels. For example, if Tony Blair really believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when he persuaded Britain to go to war in 2003, was it actually a lie? How do you define sincerity? How can you measure it? And would you even elect a national leader if you expected that they'd be unable to lie to you? There is a lengthy discussion in [906], and the debate is linked to other work on motivated reasoning. Russell Golman, David Hagman and George Loewenstein survey research on how people avoid information, even when it is free and could lead to better decision-making: people at risk of illness avoid medical tests, managers avoid information that might show they made bad decisions, and investors look at their portfolios less when markets are down [782]. This strand of research goes all the way back to Sigmund Freud, who described various aspects of the denial of unpleasant information, including the ways in which we try to minimise our feelings of guilt for the bad things we do, and to blame others for them.

It also links up with **filter-bubble effects** on social media. People prefer to listen to others who confirm their beliefs and biases, and this can be analysed in terms of the hedonic value of information. People think of themselves as honest and try to avoid the ethical dissonance that results from deviations [173]; criminologists use the term **neutralisation** to describe the strategies that rule-breakers use to minimise the guilt that they feel about their actions (there's an overlap with both filter effects and self-deception). A further link is to Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber's work on the brain as a machine for argument, which I mentioned above.

The fourth thread is **intent**. The detection of hostile intent was a big deal in our ancestral evolutionary environment; in pre-state societies, perhaps a quarter of men and boys die of homicide, and further back many of our ancestors were killed by animal predators. So we appear to have evolved a sensitivity to sounds and movements that might signal the intent of a person, an animal or even a god. As a result, we now spend too much on defending against threats that involve hostile intent, such as terrorism, and not enough on defending against epidemic disease, which kills many more people– or climate change, which could kill even more.

There are other reasons why we might want to think about intent more carefully. In cryptography, we use logics of belief to analyse the security of authentication protocols, and to deal with statements such as 'Alice believes that Bob believes that Charlie controls the key K'; we'll come to this in the next chapter. And now we realise that people use theories of mind to understand each other, philosophers have got engaged too. Dan Dennett derived the **intentional stance** in philosophy, arguing that the propositional attitudes we use when reasoning– beliefs, desires and perceptions– come down to the intentions of people and animals.

A related matter is **socially-motivated reasoning**: people do logic much better if the problem is set in a social role. In the Wason test, subjects are told they have to inspect some cards with a letter grade on one side, and a numerical code on the other, and given a rule such as "If a student has a grade D on the front of their card, then the back must be marked with code 3". They are shown four cards displaying (say) D, F, 3 and 7 and then asked "Which cards do you have to turn over to check that all cards are marked correctly?" Most subjects get this wrong; in the original experiment, only 48% of 96 subjects got the right answer of D and 7. However the evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby found the same problem becomes easier if the rule is changed to 'If a person is drinking beer, he must be 20 years old' and the individuals are a beer drinker, a coke drinker, a 25-year-old and a 16-year old. Now three-quarters of subjects deduce that the bouncer should check the age of the beer drinker and the drink of the 16-year-old [483]. Cosmides and Tooby argue that our ability to do logic and perhaps arithmetic evolved as a means of policing social exchanges.

The next factor is **minimisation**– the process by which people justify bad actions or make their harm appear to be less. I mentioned Nigerian scammers who think that white people who fall for their scams must be racist, so they deserve it; there are many more examples of scammers working up reasons why their targets are fair game. The criminologist Donald Cressey developed a **Fraud Triangle theory** to explain the factors that lead to fraud: as well as motive and opportunity, there must be a **rationalisation**. People may feel that their employer has underpaid them so it's justifiable to fiddle expenses, or that the state is wasting money on welfare when they cheat on their taxes. Minimisation is very common in cybercrime. Kids operating DDoS-for-hire services reassured each other that offering a 'webstresser' service was legal, and said on their websites that the service could only be used for legal purposes. So undermining minimisation can work as a crime-fighting tool. The UK National Crime Agency bought Google ads to ensure that anyone searching for a web stresser service would see an official warning that DDoS was a crime. A mere £3,000 spent between January and June 2018 suppressed demand growth; DDoS revenues remained constant in the UK while they grew in the USA [457].

Finally, **the loss of social context** is a factor in **online disinhibition**. People speak more frankly online, and this has both positive and negative effects. Shy people can find partners, but we also see vicious flame wars. John Suler analyses the factors as anonymity, invisibility, asynchronicity and the loss of symbols of authority and status; in addition there are effects relating to psychic boundaries and self-imagination which lead us to drop our guard and express feelings from affection to aggression that we normally rein in for social reasons [1849].

Where all this leads is that the nature and scale of online deception can be modulated by suitable interaction design. Nobody is as happy as they appear on Facebook, as attractive as they appear on Instagram or as angry as they appear on Twitter. They let their guard down on closed groups such as those supported by WhatsApp, which offer neither celebrity to inspire performance, nor anonymity to promote trolling. However, people are less critical in closed groups, which makes them more suitable for spreading conspiracy theories, and for radicalisation [523].
