# 🔐 **1.7 Definitions in Security Engineering**  

There are many terms in this field that can be misleading. Let's look at the key concepts!  

---

## * **What is a "system"?**  

The term **"system"** can mean different levels:  

| Level                 | Example                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **1. Component**      | Cryptographic protocol, smart card |
| **2. Infrastructure** | OS + servers + network             |
| **3. Applications**   | Banking software, med. systems     |
| **4. IT staff**       | Admins, developers                 |
| **5. Internal Users** | Company employees                  |
| **6. External users** | Clients, intruders                 |

> **💡 Problem:** It is often said that "hardware is safe," but the system breaks down due to the human factor.

## 👥 **Who are "Alice" and "Bob"?**  

In cryptography and security, it is customary to call protocol participants by their names:
- **Alice** — usually the sender.  
- **Bob** — the recipient.  
- **Eve** — the attacker (eavesdropper).  

But it is important to clarify:
- **Is Alice a person or her gadget?**  
- **Does she prove her name or just access?**  

> **An example from Java:**  
> ```java  
> if (user.hasAccess("Alice")) {  
> System.out.println("Access is allowed!");  
> } else {  
> System.out.println("Access denied.");  
> }  
> ```

## 🔑 **Key terms**  

| Term          | Definition                                | Example                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Subject**   | Individual (person)                       | User, hacker               |
| **Principal** | System participant (person, device, role) | Alice, server, admin group |
| **Group**     | Multiple principals                       | "All Managers"             |
| **Role**      | Function performed by different people    | "Chief Physician", "Admin" |

> **⚠️ Identity ≠ Name!**  
> - **Name** is just a label ("Bob").  
> - **Identity** — confirmation that this is **the same** Bob.  

---

## 🔒 **Trust vs. Reliability**  

- **A trusted system** is one whose failure violates the security policy.  
- **A reliable system** is one that **will not fail**.  

> **Example:**  
> An NSA employee selling secrets to China is **trusted, but not reliable**.  

---

## 🕵️ **Privacy vs. Privacy vs. Secrecy**  

| Term        | Definition                                    | Example                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Privacy** | Technical data protection                     | Encryption               |
| **Privacy** | The obligation to keep other people's secrets | Medical secrecy          |
| **Privacy** | The right to personal space                   | Personal data protection |

> **💡 The difference:**  
> - **Confidentiality** — for organizations (for example, a bank stores customer data).  
> - **Privacy** — for people (for example, your correspondence in the messenger).  

---

## 🎭 **Authenticity and Integrity**  

- **Integrity** — data has not been changed.  
- **Authenticity** — the data **is not only intact**, but also **relevant**.  

> **Example:**  
> The expired receipt (6 months) has **integrity**, but **is not authentic**.  

---

# What is "vulnerability" and "hacking"?**  

- **Vulnerability** is a weak point in the system.  
- **Hacking (hack)** — using the system ** in an unexpected way**.  

> **Examples of hacking:**  
> - **Finance:** The use of loopholes in the tax code.  
> - **Technology:** Password bypass via SQL injection.  
> - **Politics:** Filibustering in Parliament.  

---

## 🛡️ **Security Policy vs. The purpose of security**  

| Term                | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Security Policy** | General rules ("Employee-only access")       |
| **Security goal**   | Specific measures (2FA, encryption, logging) |

> **Example:**  
> ```  
> Politics: "Transactions > $1M require two signatures."  
> Goal: "Use ECDSA for digital signatures."  
> ```

## 🔥 **Security vs. Reliability**  

In engineering **safety** and **protection (security)** closely related:  

| Term       | Definition                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Hazard** | Condition leading to an accident |
| **Risk**   | Probability of an accident       |
| **Safety** | No accidents                     |

> **Example:**  
> In aviation, ** the safety policy** prohibits the transportation of explosives, and ** the safety case** proves that the engine will not fail in flight.  

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion**  

📌 **The main thing:**  
- Security is ** not only technology**, but also ** rules, people and context**.  
- **Language is important:** One term can mean different things in different fields.

**The security engineer must be precise in his definitions!** 🚀
