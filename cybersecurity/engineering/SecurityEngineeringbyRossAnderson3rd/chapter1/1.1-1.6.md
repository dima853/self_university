# 🔐 **Security Engineering: what is that?**  

**Security Engineering** is the design of systems that remain reliable even in the presence of malicious attacks, errors, or accidental failures. 🏗️  

This is an interdisciplinary field that unites:  
- **Cryptography** 🔐  
- **Computer security** 💻  
- **Hardware protection** 🛡️  
- **Economics, Psychology, Law** ⚖️  
- **System engineering** (business process analysis, testing)  

> 💡 **Important!** Security is not only about preventing threats, but also ensuring that the system works properly under attack.

# 1.1 Why is this important?**  

Failures in secure systems can lead to:  
- **Loss of life** (for example, NPP control systems) ☢️  
- **Financial disasters** (ATMs, payment systems)  
- **Violation of privacy** (medical records)  
- **Increased crime** (alarms, immobilizers)  

> **A real-life example:**  
> If the system seems vulnerable (even if it is not), it can already damage reputation and trust.

## 🔍 **1.2 Basic security components**  

To build a reliable system, you need to consider **4 key aspects**:  

| Component        | Description                          | Example                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Politics** 📜   | What needs to be protected?          | Knives were banned in airports after 9/11 |
| **Mechanisms** ⚙️ | How to protect?                      | Encryption, access control                |
| **Guarantees** ✅ | How reliable are the mechanisms?     | Testing, auditing                         |
| **Motivation** 💰 | Why would people protect the system? | Guards' salary, fear of fines             |

> **An example from Java:**  
> ```java  
> // Policy: only authorized users can read the file  
> if (user.isAuthenticated()) {  
>     File secretFile = new File("secret.txt");  
> System.out.println("Access allowed: " + secretFile.read());  
> } else {  
> System.out.println("Error: Access denied!");  
> }  
> ```

# 1.3 Example 1: Banking systems**  

Banks use a variety of secure systems:
1. **Accounting systems** — protection against internal fraud.  
   - Double confirmation of transactions.  
   - Analysis of suspicious transactions.  

2. **ATMs (ATM)** — protection against hacking and fraud.  
   - Use of **PIN codes** and **chip cards**.  
   - Example of vulnerability: "phantom withdrawals" due to software errors.  

3. **Online banking** — protection against phishing.  
   - **SMS codes** to confirm transactions.  
   - But attackers can intercept the number through SIM swapping.  

4. **Interbank transfers** — protection from hackers.  
   - Cryptography + access control.  

> **Fact:** In 2016, hackers from North Korea stole **$81 million** through the SWIFT system of Bangladesh Bank.

# 1.4 Example 2: Military bases**  

Military systems are among the most secure:
- **Communication encryption** (from ancient Egypt to Bluetooth).  
- **Electronic warfare** (radar jamming, spoofing).  
- **Protection of nuclear weapons** (biometrics, sensors).  

> **A real-life example:**  
> The Iris scan developed for the military is now used in **Aadhaar** (Identification system in India).

## 🏥 **1.5 Example 3: Hospitals**  

Medical systems must protect:  
1. **Patient safety** (for example, infusion pumps).  
2. **Confidentiality** (access to medical records is only for doctors).  
3. **Anonymization of data** (for research).  

> **Problem:** In 2017, the WannaCry virus paralyzed British hospitals because X-rays were transmitted through a vulnerable server.  

---

## 🏠 **1.6 Example 4: Home systems**  

Even at home there are secure systems:
- **Smart locks** (can be hacked through a signal repeater).  
- **Children's GPS watches** (banned in the EU due to data leaks).  
- **Voice assistants** (Alexa, Google Home can record conversations).  

> **The Council:** Turn off the microphones in your smart devices if you are not using them!

## 🔚 **Conclusion**  

Security engineering is an integrated approach to system protection. It is necessary to take into account not only technology, but also ** the human factor, economics and laws**.
