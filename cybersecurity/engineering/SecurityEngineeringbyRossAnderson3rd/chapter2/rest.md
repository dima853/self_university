2## 2.2.4 The Middle East and other players: cyber-repression and digital authoritarianism**  

#### **🔍 Common features of authoritarian regimes**  
- **Strict Internet control** (blackouts, censorship).  
- **A combination of hacker attacks with physical violence**.  
- **The use of Western technologies for surveillance** (software from the USA, EU, Israel).

### **🕵️‍♂️ Key players and methods**  

#### **1. UAE: iPhone spying and phishing**  
- **Project Karma** (2014-2019):
- Hacking the iPhone ** of dissidents and foreign officials** through vulnerabilities in iMessage.  
  - Phishing with malicious PDFs (like Chinese hackers).  
  - **Targets:** human rights defenders, journalists, even **American citizens**.  
- **Base of operations:** A villa in Dubai with a team of mercenaries and local specialists.  

#### **2. Saudi Arabia: assassinations + hacker attacks**  
- **The murder of Jamal Khashoggi** (2018) → Jeff Bezos' leaked correspondence.  
  - Hacking via **malicious WhatsApp message** (sent from the Crown Prince's phone!).  
- **Espionage via Twitter** (2020):
- Two former employees of the social network shared critical account data with the Saudi government.  

#### **3. Syria: Digital torture**  
- **Tactics:**
- **Rape threats** to the families of those arrested if they do not give up their passwords from social networks.  
  - **Mass collection of contacts** → arrests of all "suspicious" connections.  
- **Technologies:**
- The use of **European spyware** (for example, German surveillance equipment).  

#### **4. Iran: from Stuxnet to Shamoon**  
- **Response to Western attacks:*
* - After Stuxnet (2010), Iran began actively developing cyber warfare.  
  - **Attack on Aramco** (2012): The **Shamoon** virus destroyed 30,000 computers of the Saudi oil company.  
  - **Hacking DigiNotar** (2011): forging SSL certificates to spy on dissidents.  
- **Modernity:**
- Attacks on **Israeli water treatment plants** (2020) → retaliatory strike on the Iranian port.  

#### **5. North Korea: Vandal hackers**  
- **Attack on Sony Pictures** (2014):
- Leaked films, correspondence, threats of terrorist attacks → cancellation of the premiere of the comedy about Kim Jong-un.  
- **WannaCry** (2017):
- Global epidemic of "ransomware" (actually, sabotage).  
  - Victims: Nissan, Renault, British hospitals.  
- **Thefts of cryptocurrencies** (2019):  
  - **$1 billion** stolen from stock exchanges (according to the UN).

### **⚠️ The problem: global trade in cyberweapons**  
- **Supplier companies:**
- Israel (**NSO Group**), Germany, USA.  
  - They sell **spyware** (Pegasus, FinFisher) to dictators.  
- **Effects:**
* **Dissidents in the EU/USA** are also under attack (for example, Saudi surveillance of dissidents in London).  

---

### **🔮 The future of digital authoritarianism**  
1. **The growth of "smart" repression** (AI for analyzing social networks + automatic arrests).  
2. **More attacks on infrastructure** (as in Iran and Saudi Arabia).  
3. **Cyber sanctions** (as against NSO Group in 2021).
