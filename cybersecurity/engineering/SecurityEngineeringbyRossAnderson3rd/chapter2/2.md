### **⚔️ 2.2.1.11 Offensive Operations**  

#### **🖥️ US Cyber Command & Stuxnet**  
- **The director of the NSA also heads the US Cyber Command** (since 2009).
- **Stuxnet (2010)** — the first cyber weapon that changed the rules of the game:
- **Goal:** sabotage of Iranian centrifuges for uranium enrichment.  
  - **How did you work?**
- Exploited **4 zero-day vulnerabilities** + **stolen digital certificates**.  
    - Infected Windows PCs, searched for **Siemens PLC** (programmable controllers).  
    - **Rootkit** covertly changed the rotation speed of centrifuges, causing breakdowns.  
    - **The air gap was overcome through infected USB flash drives**.  
  - **Developers:** USA + Israel.  
  - **Side effect:** The virus has "escaped" to other countries (Central Asia, Indonesia).  

🔹 **Consequences of Stuxnet:**  
- **The cyber Arms race** — Countries have begun actively developing their own "digital bombs".  
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities have risen sharply** (have become a strategic resource).

### **📈 2.2.1.12 Attack Scaling**  

#### **📶 From tracking one → to tracking all**  
- **Old school:**  
  - Eavesdropping on one phone = **dangerous, difficult, unreliable** (25% signal loss).  
  - Example: "car with antenna" for GSM interception.  
- **New School (Five Eyes):**
- **"Collect everything!"** → antennas on embassies, hacking telecoms.  
  - **High start-up costs, but the cost of one "sacrifice" is → pennies**.  

#### **💥 Scaling up cyber attacks**  
- **Kinetic Wars:**  
  - 1 saboteur = 1 destroyed radar station.  
  - 1000 drones = the destroyed power grid of the country.  
- **Cyber warfare:**  
  - **Mugshot (NSA)** — vulnerability finder for the entire network:  
    - A database of all software versions in the world.  
    - Instant selection of exploits for the target.  
  - **Example:** an attack not on one power plant, but on ** the entire power grid**.  

#### **🌍 Global impacts**  
- ** China, Russia, the EU** are trying to create "digital zones" inaccessible to Five Eyes.  
- **New players:** Private military companies (PMCs), sellers of cyber weapons.  
- **The main question:**
> *"How can we scale our cyber capabilities without depending on the United States?"*

### **💡 Key findings**  
1. **Stuxnet showed:** Cyberweapons can **physically destroy** infrastructure.  
2. **Modern espionage = Big Data** (collecting everything → analyzing later).  
3. **The future of wars:** not nuclear bombs, but ** targeted cyber attacks on critical infrastructure**.  

🚀 *"Whoever owns the Internet owns the world."* (But so far the leaders are Five Eyes.)
