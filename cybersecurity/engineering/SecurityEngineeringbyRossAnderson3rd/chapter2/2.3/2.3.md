## 2.3 Cybercrime: the digital crime of the 21st century**  

#### **📊 The scale of the problem**  
- **Share in total crime:** ~50% in developed countries (in terms of volume and damage).  
- **The police spend <1% of the budget** on combating cybercrime.  
- **Examples of ignoring:**
- USA: for a long time they considered it "identity theft" and did not take it into account.  
  - United Kingdom (2005-2015): The victims were told to complain to the bank, not to the police.

## **🛠️ 2.3.1 Criminal infrastructure**  
Modern cybercrime is an industry with a clear specialization:  

### **🤖 2.3.1.1 Botnets**  
**Evolution:**  
1. **1996:** The first attack on ISP Panix (SYN flood through hacked Unix machines).  
2. **2000s:**
-**Cutwail** (2007) — sent **50 million spam per minute** from 1 million infected PCs.  
   - **Storm** (2007) — A P2P botnet for spam, DDoS and theft of bank data.  
3. **2010s:**
- **Mirai** (2016) — botnet of **IoT devices** (cameras, routers). Attacked DynDNS → Twitter crashed.  
   - **Modern botnets:** small (10-50 thousand machines) + multilayer (P2P + DGA).  

**Cleaning problem:**  
- Users ** do not update the software** while the PC is "running".  
- Providers (for example, Comcast) isolate infected devices in a sandbox.

### **🦠 2.3.1.2 Malware Developers**  
**Specializations:**  
- **Exploits:** bypassing ASLR, stack canaries (see section 6.4.1).
- **Trojans:** Remote access to victims.

## **🔮 The future of cybercrime**  
1. **The growth of attacks on IoT** (smart homes, medical devices).  
2. **Using AI** to automate attacks (for example, deepfake voices for CEO fraud).  
3. **Complication of laundering schemes** (cryptocurrencies, NFTs).
