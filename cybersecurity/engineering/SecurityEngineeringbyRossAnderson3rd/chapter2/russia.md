### **🌐 2.2.3 Russia: Hacker power in the Kremlin's shadow**  

#### **🔍 Features of the Russian cyber strategy**  
1. **There are no global IT platforms** (as in the USA/China) → bet on **hacker attacks**.  
2. **Hybrid Warfare** = cyber attacks + propaganda + "green men" (unmarked forces).  
3. **Goals:**
***Destabilization of the West** (undermining confidence in elections and the media).  
   - **Support for authoritarian regimes** (Brexit, Trump, right-wing EU parties).  
   - ** Direct benefit** (for example, rising oil prices after the attacks on Ukraine).

### **💥 Key Russian cyber attacks**  

#### **1. Estonia (2007) – the first "cyber war"**  
- **Reason:** Transfer ** of the Bronze Soldier** (monument to the USSR) in Tallinn.  
- **Method:** **DDoS** against banks, government agencies, and the media.  
- **The result:** Estonia has turned to **NATO** → Creation of the Tallinn Cyber Warfare Manual.  

#### **2. Georgia (2008) – Hackers + tanks**  
- **Hacker attacks** + **military intervention**.  
- **Innovation:** A website with **a list of goals** for "patriot volunteers".  

#### **3. Ukraine (2014–present) – Hybrid warfare laboratory**  
- **2014:** Hacking **election commissions** (fake election results).  
- **2015:** **The world's first cyberattack on the power grid** (230,000 people without electricity).  
- **2017:** **NotPetya** is the most destructive cyber worm in history:
- **Victims:** Maersk ($300 million in losses), FedEx, Mondelez, Chernobyl nuclear power plant.  
  - **Technology:** Vulnerability **EternalBlue** (stolen from NSA) + Mimikatz (password theft).  
  - **Feature:** Disguise as ** a ransomware program**, but without the possibility of decryption → pure sabotage.  

#### **4. Interference in the US election (2016) and Brexit**  
- **Methods:**
- **Hacking of the Democratic Party's mail** (GRU) → leaks via WikiLeaks.  
  - **Troll farms** (IP "Internet Research Agency").  
  - **Dark advertising** on social networks (the target is the states of the "Rust Belt").  
- **The result:**
-**Scandal** (Mueller investigation).  
  - **Sanctions**, but Trump became president anyway.

### **🛠️ Tactics of Russian hackers**  
- **Phishing** (letters "from colleagues").  
- **Zero-day exploits** (EternalBlue, Mimikatz).  
- **Theft of tools** (for example, from the NSA).  
- **Masquerading as cybercriminals** (for example, "extortionists" who are actually the GRU).  

---

### **📌 Political consequences**  
- **The rise of authoritarianism** in the EU/USA (support for right-wing populists).  
- ** Ukraine as a testing ground ** for attacks on infrastructure.  
- **New norms of cyber warfare** (for example, an attack on the power grid = "an act of war").  

---

### **💡 Conclusion**  
- **Russia is not trying to "win" the cyber war — it wants chaos.**  
- **Main weapon:** Disinformation + attacks on critical infrastructure.  
- **The future:**
- More **NotPetya 2.0** (attacks on logistics, energy).  
  - Deepening the ** split of the West** through social media.
