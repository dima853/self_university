### **🐉 2.2.2 China: The digital dragon in the age of cyber conflict**  

#### **🌏 China vs. USA: the struggle for technological dominance**  
- **2- I am the economy of the world**, but **the 1st in terms of cyber espionage** (according to the US version).  
- **Strategy:**
- **Strict control within the country** (Great firewall, censorship of social networks).  
  - **Active data collection abroad** (attacks on government agencies, corporations, activists).

### **🔍 Key operations of Chinese hackers**  

#### **1. Operation Aurora (2009)**  
- **Goal:** hacking the infrastructure of **Google** to identify Chinese agents who were being monitored by the FBI.  
- **Effects:**
- Google has abandoned a censored search engine in China.  
  - **Blocking Facebook, Twitter, YouTube** is the beginning of the era of "digital sovereignty".  

#### **2. Attacks on Tibetan dissidents (2008)**  
- **Method:** Phishing through **fake PDF attachments** (exploit in Adobe Reader).  
- **Scale:**
- 35 of the 50 computers of the Tibetan government in exile have been hacked.  
  - The data was sent to **3 Chinese special services**.  
- **Technology:**** Russian criminal software** (Trojans) was used.  

#### **3. OPM Hacking (2015) — "Database for blackmail"**  
-**Leaked data of 22 million U.S. government employees**, including:
- Fingerprints.  
  - Confidential interviews (drugs, gay relationships, contacts with foreigners).  
- **The goal of the Chinese:**
- Compromising employees with access to secrets.  
  - Discrediting potential informants.  

#### **4. Technology theft**  
- **F-35 Joint Strike Fighter** (2013) — fighter blueprints stolen.  
- **Industrial espionage** through **APT groups** (for example, **Wicked Panda/Barium**):
- Introduction of backdoors into software updates (Asus, games, PC utilities).  
  - Infection of **millions of devices** for surveillance.  

#### **5. Attacks on Uighurs (2020)**

### **🛠️ Methods of Chinese hackers**  
1. **Phishing** (fake emails from colleagues).  
2. **Vulnerability Exploitation** (PDF, SOFTWARE, Firmware).
3. **Supply chain hacking** (infected updates).  
4. **Cooperation with "patriotic hackers"** (students, criminal groups).
5. **Data theft via telecoms** (as in operation **APT10**).

### **📌 Political consequences**  
- **2019: Ban on Huawei in the USA** (suspicion of backdoors for Chinese intelligence services).  
- **2020: Stricter control over 5G** (NATO countries exclude Chinese suppliers).  
- **Chinese response:**
- Development of proprietary technologies (**OS Harmony, Loongson processors**).  
  - Pressure on Western companies (**TikTok, WeChat** as tools of soft power).

### **💡 Conclusion**  
- **China combines strict internal control with aggressive external espionage.**  
- **Main objectives:** technology, political dissidents, leverage (blackmail).  
- **The future:**
- The growth of cyberwarfare between the United States and China**.  
  - The struggle for **global communication standards** (5G/6G, AI).  

> *"Whoever controls the data controls the future."*  
*** But for now, China and the United States are sharing this control in a cold cyberwar mode.** 🚀
