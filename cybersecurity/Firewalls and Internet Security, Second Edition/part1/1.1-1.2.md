### **Basic Principles of Security (Security Truisms)**  

#### **1. There is no absolute security**  
- It is possible to significantly increase the cost of hacking for an attacker, but there is no 100% guarantee.  
- Even the nuclear codes are not 100% secure (for example: the president of the United States once left them in a suit sent to the dry cleaners).  
- This is not a reason to abandon the Internet: banks are also not perfectly protected, but they take risks into account in their business plans.  

#### **2. Security is an economic issue**  
- It is necessary to evaluate:
- The value of the protected data.  
  - The resources that an attacker is willing to spend on an attack.  
- Sometimes a simple protection (for example, a $40 device) can stop an attack that requires $100 million.  

#### **3. All levels of protection must be equally strong.**  
- It makes no sense to put an armored door if there is a cardboard wall at the back.  
- Examples of weaknesses:
- Reliable firewall, but employees are vulnerable to social engineering.  
  - Protection from external attacks, but the cleaner sold access.  

#### **4. Attackers bypass the defense, rather than breaking it head-on.**  
- Their goal is to find the weakest link.  

#### **5. Use multi-layer protection (Defense in Depth)**  
- If one layer falls, the rest can save the situation.  
- Historical examples:
- Castles with multiple walls.  
  - An immune system with redundant mechanisms.  

#### **6. Don't rely on "security through obscurity"**  
- Assume that the attacker knows your entire system.  
- It is possible to keep the configuration secret, but this should not be the only protection.  
- Example: The Great Wall of China looked intimidating, but some of its parts were weak (for example, with rice mortar).  

#### **7. Keep protection simple**  
- Complex systems are more difficult to analyze and maintain.  
- Key security elements should be compact and understandable.  

#### **8. The principle of minimum Privilege**  
- Users and programs should get exactly as many rights as they need to work.  
- Example: a car key for jack â€” without access to the trunk.  

#### **9. Programming is a difficult task**  
- Error-free programs are very difficult to write.  
- The larger the code, the higher the risk of vulnerabilities.  

#### **10. Security should be part of the original design.**  
- Later-added protection is often less reliable.  

#### **11. If the program is not running, its vulnerabilities are not dangerous.**  
- Minimize the number of running services.  

#### **12. The program is unsafe until proven otherwise.**  
- By default, block everything except what is explicitly allowed.  

#### **13. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.**  
- It is enough for an attacker to find one vulnerability.  

#### **14. Security is a compromise with convenience.**  
- Excessive protection can irritate users and reduce productivity.  
- Good design makes security invisible (for example: modern electronic locks in hotels).  

#### **15. Don't underestimate the value of your data**  
- Even ordinary information can be valuable (for example, contact lists of a journalist).

### **Choosing a Security Policy**  

#### **1. Key issues in policy development:**  
- **What are we protecting?** (data, access, reputation).  
- **Who can attack?** (hackers, competitors, government agencies).  
- **How much security can we afford?** (finance, convenience, productivity).  

#### **2. Stance: from paranoia to permissiveness**
- **"Everything that is not allowed is forbidden"** (strict control).  
- **"Everything is allowed that is not prohibited"** (flexibility, but higher risks).  
- **Complete disconnection from the network** (an extreme measure, but not always practical).  

#### **3. The security policy must be explicit.**  
- If you have not defined the rules, everything is allowed by default.

### **Conclusion**  
Security is a balance between protection, cost and convenience. There are no universal solutions, but there are proven principles: **layering, minimal privileges, simplicity and awareness of risks**.
