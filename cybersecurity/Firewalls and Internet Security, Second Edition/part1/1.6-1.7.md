### **Ethics of computer security**  

#### **1. Why is safety ethical?**  
Computer security is not just a technical task, but also a moral responsibility.  

**Three key arguments:**  
1. **Privacy Protection**
- Personal data (bank accounts, medical records) are stored digitally.  
   - Without protection, they are vulnerable to abuse.  

2. **Respect for other people's property**
- If an organization wants to protect its systems, this is its right.  
   "Trespassing is trespassing, like breaking down a door in the real world.  

3. **Vital systems depend on security**
- Finance, telecommunications, medical equipment are controlled by computers.  
   - **Example:** In 1993, a hacker attack on a meteorological computer led to the death of a ship in the English Channel (according to Scotland Yard).  

#### **2. Where are the limits of what is acceptable?**  
**Counterintelligence vs. Retaliatory attacks**  
- **Monitoring attacks** is normal (this is your network, you have the right to know who is breaking into it).  
- ** But hacking the attacker in response** is already too much.  
  - Even if it looks like "self-defense", it is legally debatable.  
  - **Example:** In the United States, a cyberattack resulting in deaths can be punishable by life in prison.  

** Temptations and ethics**  
- Having discovered pirated software on their server, the authors *did not* replace it with infected versions (although they joked about it).  
- **The principle:** "Hackers are behaving badly— but that's not an excuse for us."  

#### **3. Cyberwar and reality**  
- **State attacks** can be considered an act of war (according to one of the US prosecutors).  
- **Private attacks** are closer to terrorism, but they can also provoke a harsh response.  
- **Important:** Even in the era of cyber conflict, there is still room for ethical standards.  

#### **4. Warning to readers**  
The authors ask:
> **"Don't test our systems for durability —we have enough work to do."**  
- This is not a challenge, but a warning.  
- Corporate security services rarely appreciate the humor of hackers.

### **Conclusion**  
Security is:
***A technical necessity** (data protection).  
✅ **Legal obligation** (compliance with laws).  
✅ **Moral duty** (respect for privacy and other people's property).  

**The main principle:**  
> * "Who guards the guardians themselves?"* (Juvenile)  
> The answer is **ethics, laws, and responsibility to society.**
