### **Network Security: strategies and approaches**  

#### **1. Host-level Security**  
**Theoretically**, each host on the network should protect itself. However, this is difficult to implement in practice.:  
- **Commercial systems come with vulnerabilities** (for example, older versions of UNIX with insecure services enabled).  
- **Even PCs have become vulnerable** (for example, Windows 95/98 web servers with critical holes).  
- **Complexity of administration** – many machines in corporate networks have not been updated for years.  

**Trust issues between hosts:**  
- If one host is compromised, an attacker can attack others through trust mechanisms (for example, rlogin, Kerberos).  

**Output:**  
- **Theoretically,** host security is possible.  
- **In practice,** most systems are vulnerable due to the complexity of configuration and the human factor.

#### **2. Perimeter Security**  
**Analogy:** If it is difficult to protect every house in the city, you can build a wall around the whole city.  

**What is a firewall?**  
- This is a "wall" between the internal network and the Internet.  
- **Three key properties:**  
  1. All traffic passes through it.  
  2. Only authorized traffic is allowed.  
  3. The firewall itself is tamper-resistant.  

**Advantages of firewalls:**  
✅ **Easier to administer** (fewer services → fewer vulnerabilities).  
✅ **Professional administration** (fewer errors than regular users).  
***No "regular users"** – less risk of weak passwords.  
***Centralized control** (mail, FTP, web access).  

**But a firewall is not a panacea:**  
- If an attacker enters through another channel (for example, a modem), the firewall will not help.  
- **Internal threats** (employees) remain a risk.  

**Recommendation:**  
- **Use internal firewalls** to protect critical network segments (for example, accounting from other departments).

#### **3. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**  
**The problem:** Where to host public services (web server, mail)?  
- **Inside the network** – the risk of hacking and attacks on internal resources.  
- **Outside ** – too vulnerable.  

**Solution: DMZ is a "neutral zone" between two firewalls.**  
- **Example:** The web server in the DMZ can access the database inside the network, but the database checks the requests as potentially dangerous.  
- **The principle of "Defense in Depth":**
- Even if an attacker enters the DMZ, the internal network will remain protected.  

**Important:**  
- DMZ administration should be strict (only via secure connections, for example, SSH).  
- **Don't trust the cars in the DMZ!**

#### **4. Encryption is not a silver bullet**  
** The myth:** "Encryption solves all security problems."  
**Reality:**  
- **Cryptography ≠ security.** An attacker can bypass security rather than crack it.  
- **Risks:**
- Weak algorithms or keys.  
  - Implementation errors (for example, SSL bugs).  
  - Physical access to the machine (software substitution, keyloggers).  
  - Loss of keys (for example, a forgotten password).  

**When encryption is useful:**  
- **Backup tapes** – they are often insufficiently protected.  
- **Data transfer** (HTTPS, VPN).  

** But:**  
- If the system is not physically secured, encryption will not help.

### **Conclusion: Secure network strategies**  
1. **Firewalls** are the basis of protection, but not the only one.  
2. **DMZ** – to isolate public services.  
3. **Encryption** is important, but it does not replace other measures.  
4. **Deep protection** – multiple layers of security.  
5. ** Do not forget about internal threats ** – protection must be comprehensive.  

**The main principle:**
> *"The attacker is looking for the weakest link. Your task is to prevent him from finding it."*
