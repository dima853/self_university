# 📊 **2.8.3 Standard deviation, percentile and median**

## 🔍 **Key distribution metrics**
### 📏 **Standard deviation (σ)**
is a measure of the spread of data relative to the average
- Higher value = higher variability
- Formula:
`σ = √(Σ(xᵢ - μ)2 / N)`
where μ is the average, N is the number of observations

### 📌 **Percentiles**
| Percentile | Description                                  | Usage example              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 50th       | **Median** is the middle of the distribution | Baseline performance level |
| 90th       | 10% worst values                             | Tail analysis              |
| 99th       | 1% of the slowest queries                    | SLA metrics                |
| 99.9th     | 0.1% of extreme cases                        | Search for rare anomalies  |

**SLA example**:
"99th percentile delay < 200 ms" means that 99% of requests are executed faster than 200 ms.

# 2.8.4 Coefficient of variation (CoV)**
is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:
`CoV = σ / μ`
- **Interpretation**:
- CoV=25%: Moderate variability
  - CoV<10%: A stable system
- Alternative: **z-value** (how much σ is the value from μ)

## 🐫 **2.8.5 Multimodal distributions**
**Problem**: Classical metrics don't work well for:
- **Bimodal** distributions (e.g. cache hits/missions)
- **Multimodal** scenarios

**Practical example**:
Allocation of disk operation delays:
``text
Mode 1 (cache hits):  0-1 ms ───── 
Mode 2 (read from disk): 7-8 ms ───
Average: 3.3 ms ← Useless metric!
``

## 🚨 **2.8.6 Outliers**
**Features**:
- Rare extreme values (for example, delays >1000 ms at a rate of 10 ms)
- Sources:
- TCP timeouts
- Competition for resources
  - Equipment failures

**Detection methods**:
1. **Maximum value** (but shows only the worst case)
2. **99.9th percentile**
3. **Median and average comparison**:
``python
   if (mean - median) / median > 0.3:
print("Suspected outliers!")
``

## 📊 **Visualization is the key to understanding**
For complex distributions, use:
- **Histograms** (reveal the modes)
- **Box-plot** (shows median, quantiles, outliers)
- **Percentile graphs** (for example, delay heatmap)

**Example for a web application**:
``text
Latency Distribution (ms)
P50:   45   ┃
P90:  120   ┃▓
P99: 350 ┃▓▓▓▓
P99.9:1200 ┃▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ( emissions!)
``

## 🛠 **Practical recommendations**
1. For SLA, focus on the **99th percentile**
2. Always compare **median and average**
3. In case of anomalies, build **histograms**
4. For network systems, monitor **99.9th percentile**

> ⚠️ **Important**: Averages can be misleading. Always specify the distribution form!
