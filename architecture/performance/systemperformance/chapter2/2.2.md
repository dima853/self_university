**It is important to consider the impact of perturbations (interventions) on test results! 🔍**  

Perturbations are unexpected or background interventions that can distort the results of system performance measurements. They may occur due to:
- **planned system activity** (for example, automatic updates, backups),
- **actions of other users** (if the system is multiuser),  
- **competing workloads** (other applications or virtual machines in the cloud).  

### 🌩 **Special difficulties in cloud environments**  
In cloud infrastructures (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), a physical host can serve multiple virtual machines (VMs). The activity of neighboring VMs ("noisy neighbors") can affect your system, but remain **invisible** from inside your test environment (SUT, System Under Test). This is called **the "noisy neighbor problem"** — and it can seriously distort benchmark results!  

### 🧩 **The complexity of modern distributed systems**  
Modern environments often consist of many components:  
- ** Load balancers** (Nginx, HAProxy)  
- **Proxies and caching servers** (Varnish, Redis)  
- **Web and app servers** (Apache, Node.js)  
- **Databases** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- **Network Storage** (AWS S3, Ceph)  

Each of these elements can make its own perturbations! For example, the cache can mask the real load on the database, and network delays can affect the response time.  

### 🔎 **How to minimize the impact of perturbations?**  
1. **Careful mapping of the environment** — draw up a diagram of all system components.  
2. **Isolation of the test environment** — use dedicated resources whenever possible.  
3. **Monitoring of background processes** (for example, via `top`, `htop', Prometheus).  
4. **Statistical analysis** — multiple test runs and averaging of results.  

### 💡 **Interesting fact**  
In 2012, due to a "noisy neighbor" in Amazon EC2, one of the startups' productivity dropped by **40%** — and the problem was discovered only after a week of analysis! This shows how important it is to take into account the turbulence in the clouds.

**🚀 Conclusion:** Perturbations are the hidden enemy of accurate measurements. Always analyze the environment, isolate the interference and check the results several times!
