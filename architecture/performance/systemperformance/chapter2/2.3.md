# 2.3.3 Trade-Offs

![alt text](images\3.png)

### **Trade-offs in IT: "Pick two" and performance optimization**  

The image illustrates the classic principle **"Good, Fast, Cheap — choose two"**, adapted for IT projects:  
- **High performance** (High-Performance)  
- **Deadlines** (On-Time)  
- **Budget** (Inexpensive)  

They usually choose **"On-Time+ Inexpensive"**, sacrificing performance, which leads to problems:  
- Suboptimal storage architecture.  
- Inefficient programming languages.  
- Lack of tools for performance analysis.  

---

## **1. Key trade-offs in IT**  

### **(1) CPU vs Memory**  
- **In-memory caching** → reduces CPU load, but requires more RAM.  
- **Data compression** → saves memory, but increases CPU load.  

**Example**:
- **Redis** (in-memory cache) vs **PostgreSQL** (page compression).  

### **(2) File System block Size**
| **Small block** (4 KB)           | **Large block**(64 KB)            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Better for random I/O operations | Better for streaming reads/writes |
| Uses cache more efficiently      | Speeds up backups                 |

### **(3) Network Buffer size**
| **Small buffer** | **Large buffer** |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Less memory load | Higher bandwidth |

---

## **2. Where is it more efficient to adjust performance?**  
The closer the setting is to the application level, the greater the effect.:  

| **Level**       | **Examples of optimizations**         | **Potential gain** |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Application** | Optimization of SQL queries and logic | Up to 20x          |
| **Database**    | Indexes, partitioning                 | Up to 5x           |
| **File system** | Configuring the cache, block size     | Up to 2x           |
| **Storage**     | RAID, SSD vs HDD                      | Up to 1.5x         |

** Why?**  
An application-level fix eliminates work at all lower levels of the stack.  

---

## **3. Problems of modern approaches**  
1. **The race for functionality**:  
   - Developers focus on correctness, not performance.  
   - Performance problems are detected already in production.  

2. **Cloud environments**:
- Frequent updates (weekly/daily) complicate long-term monitoring.  
   - It is important to **monitor the OS**, even if the problem is in the application.  

---

## **4. Practical advice**  
### **(1) For developers**  
- **Profile the code** before release (for example, `perf` for Linux, `VTune` for Intel).  
- **Avoid N+1 queries** in databases.  
- **Cache** hot data (Redis, Memcached).  

### **(2) For admins**  
- **Set up OS monitoring** (Prometheus + Grafana for CPU/RAM/I/O metrics).  
- **Optimize block sizes** for load (for example, `ext4` with `bs=64k` for DBMS).  
- **Use modern storage** (NVMe for high-load systems).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
1. **Sacrifice one of the three**: speed, quality, or cost.  
2. **Optimize at the application level** — this gives maximum effect.
3. **Monitor the OS**, even if the problem seems to be "applied".

### **Optimizing block size for PostgreSQL: how to choose and why?**  
The size of a block (page) in PostgreSQL critically affects performance. Let's figure out how to choose it correctly for your workload.

---

#### **1. What is a "block" in PostgreSQL?**
- Standard size: **8 KB** (can be changed from 1 to 32 KB during compilation).
- One page = 1 block = minimum unit of I/O operations.
- Stores: table rows, indexes, metadata.

---

#### **2. How does block size affect performance?**
| **Small block (4 KB)**                                           | **Large block (16-32 KB)**                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Better for OLTP (lots of random reads/writes of short strings) | ✅ Better for analytical queries (scanning large ranges) |
| ❌ Accesses disk more often (less data per 1 I/O)                 | ❌ Spends memory on empty areas if the rows are small    |

**Example**:  
If you have a chat app (lots of inserts/updates of short messages) — **8 KB** optimal.  
For Data Warehouse (large table analytics) — **16-32 KB** will speed up `SELECT * FROM large_table'.

---

#### **3. How can I check my current performance?**
Diagnostic requests:
```sql
-- Average row size in the table
SELECT avg(pg_column_size(t.*)) FROM my_table t;

-- How many blocks are "empty" (low occupancy)
SELECT relname, 100 - (pg_relation_size(oid) / (8192 * relpages) * 100) AS "empty_space_%"
FROM pg_class WHERE relkind = 'r';
```
If `empty_space_%' is > 30%, it may be worth reducing the block size.

---

#### **4. How can I change the block size?**
1. **Only when compiling PostgreSQL** (setting `--with-blocksize=16` in `./configure`).
2. **Cannot be changed for an existing database** — only create a new cluster with a different size:
   ```bash
   initdb -D /path/to/new/data --block-size=16384
   ```
3. **Data transfer**: Use `pg_dump`/`pg_restore'.

---

#### **5. Optimal values for different scenarios**
| **Load type**             | **Recommended unit** | **Arguments**                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| OLTP (short transactions) | 8 KB                 | Minimizing overhead                   |
| Analytics (large scans)   | 16-32 KB             | Reducing the number of I/O operations |
| Mixed load                | 8 KB                 | Read/Write balance                    |

---

#### **6. What else affects I/O efficiency?**
- **TOAST**: PostgreSQL automatically compresses/separates large fields (> 2 KB).
- **Fillfactor**: Setting the page occupancy (for example, `90` for frequently updated tables).
- **File system**: 'XFS` or `ZFS` with the setting `bs=16k` to match PostgreSQL.

---

### **Conclusion**
1. **8 KB** is a safe choice for most cases.
2. **16+ KB** — only for post-test analytics.
3. **Before changing**: Measure the current efficiency via 'pg_stat_io'.

> **Tip**: For cloud databases (RDS, Cloud SQL), the block size is fixed — choose instances with preset values for your load.

### **The level of depth of performance analysis: when to stop?**  
Productivity is a balance between **analysis costs** and **potential benefits**. Let's look at how to determine the optimal level of effort for your project.

---

## **1. "Adequate level" of analysis: from startups to HFT**  
Organizations have different approaches to performance analysis depending on **ROI** (return on investment):

| **Company type**    | **The level of analysis**               | **Examples**                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Startups**        | Surface monitoring (CloudWatch, Sentry) | Checking API latency and alerts             |
| **Corporations**    | Deep analysis (perf, eBPF, CPU PMC)     | Linux kernel optimization, simulation       |
| **HFT / Exchanges** | Extreme optimization (nanoseconds)      | Laying cables for $300 million to save 6 ms |

**Key principle**: > "Adequate level" is when ** the cost of the analysis is less than the potential benefit**.


---

## **2. When should I stop the analysis?**  
### **Scenarios for stopping:**  
1. ** The main reason is explained**
- Example: A Java application eats CPU. We found exceptions that explain **12%** of the load. But since slowdown **3x**, we're looking further.  
   - **Rule**: We stop if we find **>66%** problems.  

2. **ROI is less than the cost of analysis**
- Optimization of a microservice that saves **$100/year** is not worth 10 hours of an engineer's work.  
   - **Exception**: If the problem is a "canary" for future disasters (for example, memory leak).  

3. **There are more important tasks**  
   - Even if the problem is not completely clear, there are **critical bugs** elsewhere.  

---

## **3. Recommendations "at a given time"**  
Performance settings ** become obsolete** after:  
- Hardware upgrades (for example, switching from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s).  
- Software updates (the new version of PostgreSQL may change the optimal `shared_buffers').  
- Growth in the number of users.  

**How to avoid mistakes:**  
- **Do not copy tunings from the Internet** blindly. Example:
```nginx
# Old recommendation for Linux 2.6:
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1 # May be harmful in modern kernels!
  ```  
- **Version the settings** (Git + annotations like: "Increased `vm.swappiness=10` due to swap load in 2023-01").  

---

## **4. Practical rules**  
### **For startups**  
- **Minimum**: Latency/error monitoring (New Relic, Datadog).  
- **Optimum**: Once a quarter — deep check of **slow queries** and **caching**.  

### **For corporations**  
- **Permanent** team of performance engineers.  
- **Tools**:
- `perf`/`eBPF' — for core analysis.  
  - **Load forecasting** (for example, via ML).  

### **For HFT/Exchanges**  
- **Hard SLA**: Every microsecond is money.  
- **Investments**: Custom network stacks, FPGA instead of CPU.  

---

## **5. Checklist "Where to stay?"**  
1. Have you found the cause of >50% of the problem? → **Stop, we're fixing**.  
2. Do the remaining hypotheses take **a disproportionate amount of time**? → Postpone.  
3. Are there **more important** tasks with high ROI? → Switch to.  

> **Metric**: If the analysis takes **longer than the potential savings**, you have overdone it.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
- **The depth of the analysis** depends on **budget and risks**.  
- **Tuning is outdated** — document the changes.  
- **80/20 rule**: 20% of efforts give 80% of the result.  

**Case study**:
After updating the AWS instance from `m5.large` to `m6i.xlarge', the old `kernel.schedul_migration_cost_ns` settings began to **slow down** the application. Solution: reset the parameters to default + measurements under load.  

Do you need cases for choosing tools for your stack? 😊
