> "Why you need to fully discharge the battery first and then fully charge it." 
This statement is **fundamentally wrong** for modern batteries, especially lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries, which are used in most modern devices such as phones, laptops, and electric vehicles.

**Why the old rule of "fully discharge, then fully charge" NO LONGER WORKS for Li-Ion and other modern batteries:**

* **Memory effect:** The old rule was relevant for nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries. NiCd batteries suffered from the so-called "memory effect". If such a battery was regularly charged without being completely discharged, it "remembered" this charging level and began to work as if it were its full charge, losing capacity. Li-ion batteries *do not* have a memory effect.

* **Deterioration of Li-Ion during deep discharges:** Deep discharge (discharge "to zero") for Li-Ion batteries is extremely harmful. This causes chemical changes inside the battery, which reduce its capacity and service life. Imagine that you are constantly trying to squeeze the last drop of water out of a sponge - it will quickly lose its shape and become less effective.

* **Charging cycles:** Each battery has a limited number of charging cycles (full charge from 0% to 100%).  A discharge of up to 0% and a subsequent full charge takes an entire cycle. It is better to charge the battery more often, but do not let it discharge below 20-30%.

**What to do with Li-ion batteries:**

* **Avoid deep discharges:** Do not allow the charge to drop below 20-30%.
* **Do not charge to 100% continuously:** Constant charging up to 100% can also negatively affect the battery. It is ideal to maintain the charge level in the range of 20-80%.
* **Partial charging is good:** Recharge the battery in small portions throughout the day.
* **Avoid extreme temperatures:** High and low temperatures are harmful to batteries.
* **Use the correct charger:** Use the charger designed for your device.

**In simple words:**

Imagine that a battery is a tank of water. If you always pour out the water to the last drop, the tank will wear out faster. It is much better to keep the tank half full and top up the water from time to time.

In general, the "fully discharge, then fully charge" rule is outdated advice that can harm modern Li-Ion batteries. Take care of your battery and it will last you longer!
