> "Why you need to fully discharge the battery first and then fully charge it." 
This statement is **fundamentally wrong** for modern batteries, especially lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries, which are used in most modern devices such as phones, laptops, and electric vehicles.

**Why the old rule of "fully discharge, then fully charge" NO LONGER WORKS for Li-Ion and other modern batteries:**

* **Memory effect:** The old rule was relevant for nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries. NiCd batteries suffered from the so-called "memory effect". If such a battery was regularly charged without being completely discharged, it "remembered" this charging level and began to work as if it were its full charge, losing capacity. Li-ion batteries *do not* have a memory effect.

* **Deterioration of Li-Ion during deep discharges:** Deep discharge (discharge "to zero") for Li-Ion batteries is extremely harmful. This causes chemical changes inside the battery, which reduce its capacity and service life. Imagine that you are constantly trying to squeeze the last drop of water out of a sponge - it will quickly lose its shape and become less effective.

* **Charging cycles:** Each battery has a limited number of charging cycles (full charge from 0% to 100%).  A discharge of up to 0% and a subsequent full charge takes an entire cycle. It is better to charge the battery more often, but do not let it discharge below 20-30%.

**What to do with Li-ion batteries:**

* **Avoid deep discharges:** Do not allow the charge to drop below 20-30%.
* **Do not charge to 100% continuously:** Constant charging up to 100% can also negatively affect the battery. It is ideal to maintain the charge level in the range of 20-80%.
* **Partial charging is good:** Recharge the battery in small portions throughout the day.
* **Avoid extreme temperatures:** High and low temperatures are harmful to batteries.
* **Use the correct charger:** Use the charger designed for your device.

**In simple words:**

Imagine that a battery is a tank of water. If you always pour out the water to the last drop, the tank will wear out faster. It is much better to keep the tank half full and top up the water from time to time.

In general, the "fully discharge, then fully charge" rule is outdated advice that can harm modern Li-Ion batteries. Take care of your battery and it will last you longer!

The charge range of 20-80% for lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries is optimal for maximizing service life and minimizing degradation. This is explained by the chemical processes occurring inside the battery and the influence of voltage.

â„– **Why is 20-80% the optimal range?:**

1. **High voltage (100% charge) is stressful for the battery:**

    * **Accelerated degradation:** When the Li-Ion battery is charged to 100%, the electrons are forced to "pack" into the positive electrode (usually lithium-cobalt oxide or another material). This creates a voltage inside the battery that can cause:
        * **Formation of lithium dendrites:* Lithium can be deposited as crystalline structures (dendrites) that can grow through the separator between the electrodes, leading to a short circuit and battery failure.
        * **Corrosion of the electrolyte:** The electrolyte (a liquid that carries lithium ions) can decompose under high voltage, reducing the efficiency and service life of the battery.
        * **Battery swelling:** Some side effects at high voltage can cause gases to be released, causing the battery to swell, which can damage the device.

    * **Thermal stress:** The charging process is always accompanied by heat generation. High voltage enhances this effect, especially when fully charged, which accelerates degradation.

2. **Deep discharges (0-20% charge) are also harmful:**

    * **Reduced capacity:** When discharged to low levels, the structure of the electrodes may change, which leads to a decrease in the total capacity of the battery.
    * **Irreversible chemical changes:** Deep discharges can cause irreversible chemical reactions inside the battery, which also reduces its service life.
    * **Increased internal resistance:** Discharging to zero can increase the internal resistance of the battery, which reduces its performance and shortens its service life.

3. **The optimal range (20-80%) minimizes these problems.:**

    * **Voltage reduction:** In this range, the voltage inside the battery remains relatively low, reducing the load on the electrode materials and reducing the likelihood of adverse reactions.
    * **Increased service life:** Keeping the charge in the optimal range significantly extends the battery life, allowing it to withstand more charge/discharge cycles.
    * **Reduction of heat generation:** Charging and discharging in the range of 20-80% is accompanied by less heat generation, which also helps to maintain battery performance.

**Analogy:**

Imagine that you are constantly squeezing and unclenching a sponge. If you squeeze it to the limit (100% charge) or try to squeeze every drop of water out of it (0% charge), it will quickly lose its shape and become less effective. If you keep it moist in a range where it feels comfortable, it will last longer.

**Practical tips:**

*   **If possible, avoid long-term storage of batteries at 100% charge or at full discharge.** If you intend to store the device for a long time, charge it to 40-50% and store it in a cool place.
* **It is not necessary to charge up to 100% every time.** It is usually enough to charge up to 80-90%, especially if you use the device regularly.
* **Use the charging control functions if available:** Some devices have settings that allow you to limit the maximum charge level (for example, to 80%) or optimize the charging process.
* **Don't worry too much:** If you sometimes charge to 100% or discharge to a low level, it will not kill your battery instantly.  Just try to keep the optimal range if possible to extend its service life.

In general, maintaining a charge in the range of 20-80% is the best practice for the longevity of Li-Ion batteries, due to the reduction of chemical stress and an increase in the number of charge/discharge cycles that it can withstand.
