The N-back test is a neuropsychological test used to assess and train working memory and executive functions. It is considered one of the most studied and widely used tests for assessing working memory.

**How ​​the N-back test works:**

In the simplest version of the test, stimuli (e.g. letters, numbers, images, sounds) are presented to the subject one after another. The subject's task is to determine whether the current stimulus matches the one presented N steps ago.

**Different levels of difficulty (the value of "N"):**

* **1-back:** The subject must determine whether the current stimulus matches the previous stimulus.
* **2-back:** The subject must determine whether the current stimulus matches the one presented two stimuli ago.
* **3-back, 4-back, and so on:** The higher the value of N, the more difficult the test, since the subject must hold more information in working memory and constantly update this information.

**Example (2-back test, letter stimuli):**

Sequence of stimuli: `A B C A D E C F`

| Stimulus | Should I answer "Match"? | Why?                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A        | No                       | No previous stimuli to compare.                                     |
| B        | No                       | Only one previous stimulus.                                         |
| C        | No                       | The previous stimulus, two steps back, is A.                        |
| A        | Yes                      | The current stimulus (A) is the same as the one two steps back (A). |
| D        | No                       | The current stimulus (D) is not the same as B.                      |
| E        | No                       | The current stimulus (E) is not the same as C.                      |
| C        | No                       | The current stimulus (C) is not the same as A.                      |
| F        | Yes                      | Current stimulus (F) is the same as D.                              |

**What the N-back test assesses:**

* **Working memory:** The ability to hold and manipulate information in your mind for a short period of time.
* **Executive functions:**
* **Working memory updating:** Continuously updating information stored in working memory, replacing old information with new information.
* **Attention switching:** Rapidly switching attention between stimuli and a task.
* **Inhibitory control:** Suppressing distractions and irrelevant information.

**What the N-back test is used for:**

* **Research:** To study cognitive functions related to working memory and executive functions. To study the influence of various factors (e.g., age, illness, medication) on these functions.
* **Clinical diagnostics:** Evaluation of cognitive impairment in various diseases, such as ADHD, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury.
* **Brain training:** Development and evaluation of the effectiveness of brain training programs aimed at improving working memory and executive functions.

**Advantages of the N-back test:**

* **Ease of implementation:** The test is relatively easy to implement and administer.
* **Standardized:** There are standardized procedures for conducting and scoring the test, which allows for comparison of results between subjects.
* **Sensitivity to change:** The test is sensitive enough to changes in cognitive functions, which allows it to be used to monitor progress in training or in the treatment of diseases.

**Disadvantages of the N-back test:**

* **Not comprehensive:** It mainly evaluates working memory and some executive functions. It may not provide a complete picture of a person's cognitive abilities.
* **Practice Effects:** Test scores may improve with practice, so it is important to take this into account when interpreting the results.

**In Conclusion:** The N-Back Test is a useful tool for assessing and training working memory and executive functions. It is widely used in research and clinical practice.
