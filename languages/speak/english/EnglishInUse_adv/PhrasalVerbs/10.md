**Pitfalls and Nuances**

*   **Separability:** Some phrasal verbs are separable (you can put the object between the verb and "down"), while others are not. For example, you can say "turn *the volume* down" or "turn down *the volume*," but you would always say "shout *him* down."
*   **Multiple Meanings:** As you've seen, many of these verbs have multiple meanings. The context is key to understanding the intended meaning.
*   **Idiomatic Use:** Some phrasal verbs have idiomatic uses that are hard to guess from the individual words. For example, "go down well" means "to be well-received," which isn't immediately obvious.

**Application Tips**

*   **Pay Attention to Context:** When you encounter a phrasal verb, try to understand its meaning from the surrounding sentences.
*   **Use a Dictionary:** If you're unsure, look it up in a good dictionary that includes phrasal verbs.
*   **Practice:** The best way to learn phrasal verbs is to use them actively in speaking and writing.
