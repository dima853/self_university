**General information:**

* "Around" and "About" are often (but not always) interchangeable in phrasal verbs. It is important to remember that the dictionary will usually indicate when both of them can be used.
* Only those verbs on this page where both options are impossible are marked with an asterisk *.

**A. The main meaning of "Around" and "About" in phrasal verbs**

In most phrasal verbs, "Around" and "About" retain their basic meaning. They often point to actions and situations taking place in different places, often without a clear direction or order.

* "There were books **lying around** everywhere in the room." (There were books everywhere in the room.) – "Lying around" here means "scattered", "lying in a mess".
* "The children were **running about** in the garden." – "Running about" means "running without a specific goal", "running back and forth".

**A real-life example:** Imagine a teenager's room. "Clothes are **scattered about/around** the room" - this means that clothes are scattered throughout the room, without any organization.

**Phrasal verbs with "Around" and "About" are often informal.** Let's look at a conversation between two teachers:

*   **Holly:** "Rumours have been **flying around** the staffroom lately that you're leaving. Is it true?" (There have been rumors in the staff room lately that you're leaving. Is this true?)
* **Flying around** – spread like rumors, quickly and uncontrollably.
*   **Jake:** "It amazes me how news **gets around** in this place! I did say to one or two people that I was tired of being **bossed around** by you-know-who, and, I have **asked around*** here and there to see if they need any full-time teachers, but I haven't made a decision yet(It amazes me how quickly news spreads in this place! I actually told one or two people that I was tired of being **bossed around**by-who-you-know, and I**asked around** here and there to see if they needed full-time teachers, but I haven't made a decision yet.)
    * **Gets around** – becomes known, spreads.
    * **Bossed around** – when someone is constantly giving you orders and controlling you. It's a state where you feel like a puppet.
    * **Asked around*** – ask different people. The asterisk indicates that it would not be quite right to say "ask about" in this context, "asked around" sounds more natural and with a greater intention to ask a question to different people.
*   **Holly:** "Oh, right. I heard the other day that Eleanor is sick of **running around*** after you-know-who sorting out problems he's caused. So she might leave too. By the way, do you have a copy of that new grammar book? I want to show it to my students. My copy's **floating about** here somewhere but I just can't find it." I heard the other day that Eleanor is tired of **running around** after the one-you-know, dealing with the problems he's caused. So she can leave too. By the way, do you have a copy of that new grammar textbook? My **floating about** is here somewhere, but I can't find it.)
* **Running around*** – running, fussing, doing things in a hurry, often on behalf of another person (with a negative connotation). The asterisk indicates that "running about after" in this context (taking care of and fussing over someone) is more natural than "running around after".
    * **Floating about** – being somewhere indefinitely, lying idle.
*   **Jake:** "Yes, I think I have a copy **lying around** here somewhere… Yes, you are here." (Yes, I think I have a copy lying around here somewhere... yes, here it is.)
    * **Lying around** – lying somewhere without a specific place, usually in a mess.
*   **Holly:** "Thanks very much. So, what are you up to this weekend?" (Thanks a lot. So, what are you planning for the weekend?)
* **Jake:** "Nothing much, just **pottering about** at home, really. Oh goodness! Is that the time? I have a class now." (Nothing much, I'll just mess around at home. Oh my God! Has it been that long? I have a lesson right now.)
* **Pottering about** – doing something slowly and without a specific goal, doing small chores around the house.
*   **Holly:** "OK, see you later. Don't forget that we **switched** our classrooms **around** this afternoon. You're in Room 2." (Okay, see you later. Don't forget that we **switched** our classes**around** this afternoon. You're in office number 2.)
* **Switched around** – swapped places.

**A real-life example:* Imagine that you have moved into a new apartment. "I'm just **pottering about** the house, trying to unpack." (I'm just tending around the house, trying to unpack.) - You're doing small things, settling in.

**Important note:**

* "Boss around" – emphasizes that a person is often under pressure from someone else, and not just happens in different places.

**B. Other use cases of "Around" and "About"**

Here are some more phrasal verbs using "Around" and "About":

*   "Children! Stop **playing around**! Sit politely." (Children! Stop messing around! Sit politely.) – **Playing around** means behaving stupidly, messing around.
*   "The neighbours have been **banging about** next door all morning. I wonder what they're doing." (The neighbors are making noise outside the wall all morning. I wonder what they're doing?) – **Banging about** means making loud noises by hitting something.
*   "Theo was **clowning around** at the party last night. It got very irritating." (Theo was fooling around at a party last night. It was very annoying.) – **Clowning around** means behaving stupidly and ridiculously.
* "Politicians often **skirt around*** the truth and don't give direct answers to questions." (Politicians often avoid the truth and do not give direct answers to questions.) – **Skirt around*** means to avoid discussing a difficult topic, to shirk. The asterisk indicates that "skirt about" is not used in this context.
*   "It's a problem, but I'm sure we can **work around*** it in some way." (This is a problem, but I'm sure we can work around it somehow.) - **Work around*** means finding a way to solve the problem without solving it directly. The asterisk indicates that "work about" is not used in this context.

**A real-life example:**

* You're trying to explain a difficult topic to your child: "I'm trying not to **skirt around** the issue, but it's difficult to explain." (I'm trying not to dodge the question, but it's hard to explain.)
* You ran into a problem at work: "We'll have to **work around** the budget cuts to finish this project." (We'll have to work around the budget cuts somehow to finish this project.)

**Additional information:**

* "Around" often indicates movement in a circle or around something. "About" often indicates being nearby or the topic of the conversation.
* Sometimes the choice between "around" and "about" depends on habit and regional specifics.
