**What is an idiom and a phrasal verb?**

* **An idiom ** is a stable expression, the meaning of which does not follow directly from the meanings of its constituent words. For example, "pouring water" means talking a lot and meaninglessly, rather than literally pouring water.

* **A phrasal verb** is a verb that combines with a preposition or adverb (or both) to form a new meaning. For example, "get up" is different from just "be".

When an idiom uses a phrasal verb, it can be especially confusing, since you can't just translate the words individually.
