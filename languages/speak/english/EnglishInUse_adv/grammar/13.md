**General Introduction:**

This section focuses on alternatives to the simple future (using "will") and "be going to." These options often add a nuance of *imminence*, *expectation*, *intention*, or *formality* to the expression of future events.

**Section A: Phrases with "be" + preposition + noun/gerund/infinitive**

This section introduces phrases that center around the verb "to be" and various prepositions, often followed by either a gerund (verb ending in -ing), a noun, or an infinitive (to + verb).  These phrases emphasize how close to happening something is, whether it's expected, or in a state of readiness.

1.  **"be on the verge of / brink of / point of" + (gerund or noun)**
    *   **Meaning:**  These phrases all indicate that something is very close to happening *soon*.  They suggest a state of nearness or imminence. "Brink" and "verge" suggest almost at the edge of or boundary. "Point" means the exact moment that something is about to happen.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "The company is on the verge of bankruptcy." (Bankruptcy is likely to happen very soon.)
        *   "They are on the brink of a major scientific discovery." (A discovery is imminent.)
        *   "She was on the point of crying." (She was about to cry.)

2.  **"be due to / be sure to / be bound to / be set to" + (infinitive)**
    *   **Meaning:** These phrases express varying degrees of expectation and certainty about a future event.
        *   **"be due to":**  Implies something is expected at a specific time, based on a schedule or plan.
        *   **"be sure to":** Implies a high likelihood or certainty.
        *   **"be bound to":** Similar to "be sure to," but can also suggest inevitability.
        *   **"be set to":**  Suggests that preparations have been made, and something is ready to happen.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "The train is due to arrive at 6 pm." (Expected to arrive based on the timetable.)
        *   "It's sure to rain tomorrow." (Very likely to rain.)
        *   "You're bound to pass the exam if you study hard." (Almost certain if you study.)
        *   "The new project is set to launch next month." (Everything is ready, and it will launch.)

    *   **Important Note:**  The phrase "due to" + *noun*  is also used to give a reason for something *that has already happened*. This is *not* a future tense construction:
        *   "The flight was canceled due to bad weather." (The bad weather caused the cancellation.)

**Section B:  Verbs of Intention + Infinitive, and "be looking to"**

This section focuses on how to express *intentions* and *plans* using specific verbs followed by the infinitive ("to + verb").

1.  **Verbs + "to-infinitive":**
    *   **Meaning:**  These verbs explicitly express a desire or plan to do something in the future.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "We guarantee to refund your money." (Expresses a firm promise.)
        *   "I intend to travel to Europe next year." (Expresses a clear intention.)
        *   "I hope to see you again soon." (Expresses a wish.)
    *   **List of Verbs:**  The textbook includes: aim*, agree, expect*, hope*, intend*, mean, plan*, promise, propose*, resolve, undertake, want* (The * means the verb can also be used in the present continious form to talk about intentions (e.g. I am planning to go...)

2.  **"be looking to" + infinitive:**
    *   **Meaning:**  This phrase indicates that someone is planning or intending to do something, often in a business or organizational context.
    *   **Example:**
        *   "The company is looking to expand its operations." (The company plans to expand.)

**Section C: Using Past Tense Forms to Talk About Future Events (From the Past)**

This section highlights how to express future events as viewed from a point in the *past*.  Essentially, you're talking about what *was* going to happen in the future *from a past perspective*. This often involves using the past tense forms of the phrases mentioned in Sections A and B.

*   **Examples:**
    *   "He *was due* to retire the following year." (From the perspective of 2006, his retirement was scheduled for the next year.)
    *   "She *had resolved* to learn Spanish." (At a point in the past, she made a firm decision to learn Spanish in the future.)
    *   "They *were looking* to hire new staff." (In the past, they were planning to hire.)

**Section D: "Shall" (and "Shan't") vs. "Will" (and "Won't")**

This section discusses the use of "shall" and "shan't" to express future actions.

*   **Current Usage:**  In modern English, "will" is generally used with *all* subjects (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) to talk about the future.

*   **"Shall" - Restricted Use:** "Shall" is now mostly used:
    *   **With "I" and "We":** In formal or literary contexts, "shall" *can* still be used with "I" and "we" to express the future.  However, "will" is much more common.  Using "shall" with "I" and "we" can also be used to make a *suggestion* or ask for *advice*.

*   **"Shall" - Formal/Literary Style:**  "Shall" is sometimes found in formal rules, laws, or older literature with subjects other than "I" and "we," but this is generally avoided in modern everyday English.

*   **Examples:**
    *   "I shall go to the store later." (Formal, but "I will go" is more common.)
    *   "We shall overcome." (Formal, almost poetic.)
    *   "Shall we go for a walk?" (Suggestion)
    *   "The defendant shall appear in court." (Formal, legal context.) - Not common in everyday speech.
