**A. Will and Would**

*   **General Habitual Actions/Characteristics:**

    *   **"Will" (Present):** Used to describe typical behaviors or habits happening **now**. Think of it as describing a predictable pattern.

        *   **Example:** "Every day Dan *will* come home from work and turn on the TV." This suggests that Dan consistently follows this routine.

    *   **"Would" (Past):**  Used to describe typical behaviors or habits that happened **in the past**.  It's like saying "used to" but with a slightly different nuance.

        *   **Example:** "At school, she *would* always sit quietly and pay attention."  This describes her typical behavior at school (in the past).

    *   **"Will" for General Truths:**

        *   **Example:** "Cold weather *will* kill certain plants."  This is a general statement about the predictable effect of cold weather. It's more about a scientific or natural principle.

    *   **"Would" for General Truths in the Past:**
        *   **Example:** "During the war, people *would* eat all kinds of things that we don't eat now." This sentence speaks on something that was true in the past during a certain time.

*   **Important Restriction (Will/Would):**  You **CANNOT** use "will" or "would" to talk about a specific event that happened only once in the past.

    *   **Incorrect:** "Last night I gave him a problem and he *would solve* it for me." (Suggests a repeated action, not a one-time event).
    *   **Correct:** "Last night I gave him a problem and he *solved* it for me."

*   **Will not (won't) / Would not (wouldn't):**
    *   These can be used for habitual refusal or unwillingness to do something.
        *   **Example:** "He *wouldn't* walk the five miles to his place of work." (Implies a repeated refusal or an established pattern of behavior).
        *   **Example:** "She *wouldn't* say what was wrong when I asked her."

*   **Emphatic "Will/Would" for Criticism or Annoyance (Spoken Language):**
    *   When speaking, you can stress "will" or "would" to express annoyance or disapproval of someone's behavior.
        *   **Example:** "She just *won't* do the washing up when I ask her!"  (Highlights the speaker's frustration).
        *   **Example:** "He *would* talk about people behind their backs."

*   **Using "Will" to Express Disapproval of an Action that Will Have Consequences:**

    *   This is typically used in response to a complaint.  You're saying that the negative consequence is the person's own fault.

        *   **Example:** A: "I feel sick." B: "Well, if you *will* eat so much, I'm not surprised."  (Implying that overeating is the cause of the illness).

*   **Using "Will" to Draw a Conclusion (Logical Assumption):**
    *   Using "will" to predict something that is logically expected to be happening now.
        *   **Example:** "Martina *will* be at home by now. Let's go and see her." (Suggests that, based on the time and circumstances, it's reasonable to assume Martina is home.)
        *   **Example:** "You *will* know that Ewan and Lucy are engaged." (Implying that the information is widely known or obvious.)

**B. Would and Used to**

*   **Repeated Actions in the Past (that don't happen now):**
    *   Both "would" and "used to" can describe repeated actions or habits in the past that are no longer true.

        *   **Example:** "We *used to play* in the garden." This sentence means "We played in the garden in the past, but we don't anymore."
        *   **Example:** "Whenever we went to my uncle's house, we *would / used to play* in the garden."

    *   **Important Note:** "Would" needs a clear time reference.  If the time period is not specified, "used to" is preferred.
        *   **Correct:**  "We *used to play* in the garden." (General statement about past behavior).
        *   **Less ideal (but acceptable if context exists):** "We *would play* in the garden." (Needs a context that establishes *when* this happened).

*   **Past States (that are no longer true):**
    *   Use "used to" to describe past states or conditions that have changed.  "Would" is **not** used for this.

        *   **Example:** "The factory *used to* be over there." (The factory is no longer in that location.)
        *   **Example:** "Didn't you *use to* have red hair?" (The person no longer has red hair).

*   **Specific Number of Occurrences / Fixed Times:**
    *   Neither "used to" nor "would" can be used when you're giving a precise number of times something happened or specifying an exact time when something occurred. You use the simple past tense.

        *   **Incorrect:** "We *would visit* Switzerland four times during the 1990s."
        *   **Correct:** "We *visited* Switzerland four times during the 1990s."

        *   **Incorrect:** "She *would go* to Jamaica last month."
        *   **Correct:** "She *went* to Jamaica last month."

**C. Would / Will Have + Past Participle**

*   **"Would have + Past Participle": Unreal Past Situations**

    *   Used to describe imaginary scenarios or situations that *could have* happened in the past but *didn't*.  It expresses a missed opportunity or a hypothetical outcome.

        *   **Example:** "I *would have been* happy to see him, but I didn't have time."  (The speaker wanted to see the person, but circumstances prevented it.)

*   **"Will Have + Past Participle": Logical Assumption about Past Events**

    *   Used to suggest that something probably happened in the past based on current evidence.

        *   **Example:** "As it was cloudy, few people *will have seen* last night's lunar eclipse." (The speaker believes that, because of the clouds, it is very likely that very few people saw the lunar eclipse.)
