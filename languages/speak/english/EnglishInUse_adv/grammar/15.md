# Detailed analysis of the modal verbs can, could, be able to and be allowed to

##1. Expression of ability

### 1.1 Can and be able to in the present tense

**Can** is the main verb for expressing ability in the present tense. Is used:
- To describe skills and abilities:
*She can speak five languages fluently.*
- For physical abilities:
* After the surgery, he can walk without assistance.*
- In situations "here and now":
*I can see you perfectly from here.*

**Be able to** is used in the present tense:
1. When you need to emphasize an ability after a lot of effort:
   *After months of practice, I'm finally able to play this sonata.*
2. In the future tense (will be able to):
   *You'll be able to return to work in two weeks.*
3. In other tenses where can is not used:
   *I haven't been able to sleep lately.*

Exceptions where **can** is required:
- At the moment of speech:
*Watch me — I can do a handstand!* (not I'm able to do)
- In the passive voice:
*This software can be installed on any device.*
- For the meaning of "be able to":
*Can you drive?* (aren't you able to drive?)

### 1.2 Could and was/were able to in the past tense

**Could** describes:
- General abilities in the past:
*When I was young, I could run 10 kilometers without stopping.*
- Theoretical capabilities:
* It could be very cold in Siberia in winter.*

**Was/were able to** used for:
- Specific achievements (especially with effort):
* Despite the storm, the captain was able to bring the ship to port.*
- Successful completion of the action:
* I was able to find the documents you needed.*

Important nuances:
1. In negative sentences, you can use both options:
*I couldn't/wasn't able to solve the problem.*
2. With the verbs of perception (see, hear, feel, etc.) and thinking (remember, understand), it is preferable to could:
   *I could hear strange noises coming from the attic.*
3. In constructions with "the only thing", "all" (meaning "the only thing"):
*All I could think about was my mistake.*

## 2. Expression of possibility

### 2.1 Theoretical vs. the actual possibility

**Could** express:
- A theoretical possibility (maybe, maybe not):
*This medicine could help with your symptoms.*
- Polite assumptions:
*Could this be your wallet?*

**Can** is used for:
- Actual features (what really happens sometimes):
*New York can be very crowded in summer.*
- Characteristic features:
*Gold can be dissolved in aqua regia.*

**Can't** (couldn't!) expresses:
- Confidence in the impossibility:
*That can't be true! It's impossible!*
- Ban:
*You can't park here — it's a no-parking zone.*

###2.2 Future opportunities

**Can** indicates a real probability:
*We can meet tomorrow at 5 pm if that works for you.*

**Could** assumes a lower probability or requires conditions:
*We could go hiking this weekend if the weather improves.*

##3. Expression of permission

### 3.1 In the past tense

**Could** and **was/were allowed to** for general permission:
*When I was a child, I could stay up late on weekends.*
*Students were allowed to use dictionaries during the test.*

Only **was/were allowed to** for a specific case:

In negative sentences, both options are:
*I couldn't/wasn't allowed to watch TV until I finished homework.*

### 3.2 In the present and the future
