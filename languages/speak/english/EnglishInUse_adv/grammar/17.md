These are modal verbs that are used to express probability, resolution, and possibility. But there are nuances that make their use interesting and even tricky.

**A. Main value: Probability**

* **May and Might** often have similar meanings when we talk about probability. That is, both verbs indicate that something may happen, but there is no certainty.
    * Example:
        *   "It **may** rain tomorrow." (It might rain tomorrow.)
* "It **might** rain tomorrow." (It may rain tomorrow.)

    In these examples, both options convey the same idea - there is a chance of rain.
* **Difference:**
***May** is often preferable in a formal or academic context when it comes to characteristics or behavior.
        * Example: "The seeds from the plant **may** grow up to 20 centimeters in length." (The seeds of this plant can grow up to 20 centimeters in length.)
* **Might** is more often used colloquially when we talk about what we might do in the future. It's kind of a more cautious assumption.
        * Example: "I **might** paint the kitchen purple." (Maybe I'll paint the kitchen purple.) - This means that you have an idea, but you are not sure yet that you will do it.

**A real-life example:* Imagine that you are planning a hike. If you say: "We **may** go hiking tomorrow," it sounds more formal and indicates that a decision has not yet been made, but there is a possibility. If you say: "We **might** go hiking tomorrow," it sounds like a more personal assumption, maybe you still have some doubts or other plans.

**B. Questions about probability and resolution**

* **We do not use "May" for questions about probability:** Instead of "may", "could(n't)" or the "be likely" construction is used.
    * "Could it be that you don't want to leave?" (Maybe you don't want to leave?) "That's right
    *   "May it be that you don't want to leave?" "Wrong
    * "Are you likely to be in Spain again this summer?" (Are you likely to be in Spain again this summer?) "That's right
    *   "May you be in Spain again this summer?" "Wrong
* **"Might" in questions:** Using "might" in questions about probability is possible, but it sounds more formal.
    * "Might they be persuaded to change their minds?" (Is it possible to convince them to change their minds?)
* **"May" to resolve and offer help:** "May" is still used in formal requests for permission or offers of assistance.
    *   "May I leave now?" (Can I leave now?)
* "May I help you?" (Can I help you?)

**A real-life example:** In the office, you won't ask your boss, "Might I leave early today?" (even though it's grammatically correct). Is it better to say, "May I leave early today?" It sounds more polite and corresponds to a formal setting.

**C. "Might + bare infinite" for the past**

* **"Might + bare infinite"** is used to describe what used to happen in the past. This is typical of a formal or literary style. "Bare infinitive" is an infinitive without the particle "to", that is, just a verb in its initial form.
    * "During the war, the police **might arrest** you for criticizing the government." (During the war, the police could arrest you for criticizing the government.) - That is, it was a typical situation.
    * "Years ago children **might be sent** down mines at the age of six." (Many years ago, children could be sent to mines at the age of six.) - Again, this indicates a common, albeit terrible, practice.
* **"Could + bare infinite"** can also be used to describe an ability in the past.
    * "During the war, the police **could arrest** you..." (During the war, the police could arrest you...) - This means that the police had the legal right to arrest people.

**A real-life example:* Imagine that you are writing a historical novel. You can use "might + bare infinite" to describe the ordinary events of that time, creating an atmosphere of the era.

**D. Compensating for weakness**

* When we say that someone or something compensates for some disadvantage or weakness, we can use the construction:
    * "May / might not + bare infinite... but..."
* "May / might not have + past part... but..."
* "The painting **may not be ** a masterpiece, **but** the colors are remarkable." (The painting may not be a masterpiece, but the colors are wonderful.)
    * "She **might not have danced** very gracefully, **but** she had a lot of energy and enthusiasm." (She may not have danced very gracefully, but she had a lot of energy and enthusiasm.)

**A real-life example:* You're watching a movie that you don't really like. You can say, "The plot **may not be** original, **but** the actors are fantastic." (The plot may not be original, but the actors are amazing.)

**E. "May / might + have + past participant" and "May / might + be + -ing"**

* These constructions are used to describe possible events in the past, present, and future.
    * "May / might + have + past participant" - for past events.
        *   "Do you think Laura **may / might have completed** the report by now?" (Do you think Laura might have finished the report by now?)
* "May/might+ be + -ing" - for present or future events.
        *   "Marco isn't in his office. He **may / might be working** at home today." (Marko is not in the office. Maybe he's working at home today.)
        * "When I go to Vienna I **may / might be staying** with Max, but I'm not sure yet." (When I go to Vienna, I might stay with Max, but I'm not sure yet.)
* **"Could" instead of "May" or "Might":** In these sentences, "could" can be used instead of "may" or "might".
    *   "Do you think Laura **could have completed** the report by now?" (Do you think Laura could have finished the report by now?) - This option highlights the possibility based on Laura's abilities.
* **"May / might have been + -ing"**: Used to describe possible situations or actions that have occurred for some time in the past.
    * "Callum didn't know where the ball was, but he thought his sister **might have been playing** with it before she left for school." (Callum didn't know where the ball was, but he thought his sister might have played with it before she left for school school.)

**A real-life example:* You're waiting for a friend who's late. You can say, "He **may be stuck**in traffic." (Maybe he's stuck in traffic.) If a friend isn't answering his phone, you might think: "He **might have been working** on a surprise for me, and now he is late." (Maybe he was working on a surprise for me, and that's why he was late).
