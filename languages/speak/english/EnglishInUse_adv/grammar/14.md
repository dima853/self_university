## "The future from the past" (Future in the Past): Analyzing the Grammar

This section is dedicated to the topic of "the future from the past" in English.  This means that we are talking about events that were planned for the future in the past, but we consider them in terms of the past tense.  In simple words, it's like telling what was planned in the past.

**A. Basic principles:**

* **Context:** We use "the future from the past" when we talk about events or plans that were in the future at some point in the past. This is often found in narratives, news stories, and reports about past events.
* **Forms used:** We use different grammatical forms to express "the future from the past."  The basic rule is: ** Verb in the past tense + a construction indicating the future**.

**Basic examples and explanations:**

1. **Will/Will (Future) -> Would (Future from the past):**

    * **Now (Future from now):**  I **will stay** at home this summer. (I will stay at home this summer - the future).
    * **The Past (Future from the past):**  Eleni decided that she **would stay** at home for the summer. (Eleni has decided that she will stay at home this summer - the future from the point of view of the past).
    * **A real-life example:* You tell a friend, "I'm going on vacation."  Later, you tell someone about a friend's decision: "He said he was going on vacation."  Here, "will go" is "would go".

2. **'m/is/are + going to (Planning to) -> was/were + going to (Going to):**

    * **Now (Future from now):**  I **'m not going to say** anything about the exams today. (I'm not going to say anything about exams - the intention is in the future).
    * **The Past (Future from the past):** I **wasn't going to say** anything about the exams, but the students asked me to. (I wasn't going to say anything about exams - the intention is in the past).
    * **A real-life example:** You are planning to go to the cinema. Then you tell me that you *were* going to go to the cinema, but the plans have changed.

3. **'m/is/are + -ing (Planned action) -> was/were + -ing:**

4. **Will be/is going to be + V3/ed (Liability in the future) -> would be + V3/ed:**

    * **Now (Future from now):** The exam **will have finished** by three o'clock, so I'll see you then. (The exam will be over by three o'clock).
    * **The Past (Future from the past):** The exam was so easy that most people **would have finished** after 30 minutes. (The exam was so easy that most people would have finished in 30 minutes.)
