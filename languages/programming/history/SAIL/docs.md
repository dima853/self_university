### What is [SAIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language))? Not just a sail, but a whole frigate.

**SAIL** (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language) is a programming language developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s at **Stanford University** in the famous **SAIL Laboratory** (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory). It was not just a language, but an entire ecosystem, an operating environment, and a "digital cathedral" for artificial intelligence researchers.

Imagine an era: experiments are underway with the first robots, computational linguistics, and expert systems are just emerging. For all this, a powerful, flexible and user-friendly tool was needed. SAIL has become such a tool.

### Historical context: Why did it appear?

In the late 60s, the main language for AI was **LISP**. But LISP had drawbacks: it was not very effective for low-level tasks, it was difficult to interact with hardware (and robots needed it), and not everyone liked its syntax.

The Stanford team, led by **Dan Swinehart** and with the key participation of **Bob Sproull**, took as a basis not LISP, but another language, **ALGOL 60**. They created his powerful and peculiar descendant.

### Key features and "superpowers" of SAIL

That's what made SAIL unique and cutting-edge for its time.:

####1. Hybrid Nature: "The power of Algol with the soul of Lisp"
SAIL combined:
* **Algol-like syntax:** Structured programming, nested procedures, rich control constructs (`if`, `then`, `else`, `while`). This made the code more readable and familiar to many programmers.
* **Dynamic Lisp features:** Complex data structures, associative lists, dynamic typing, garbage collection. This was necessary to work with symbolic information in AI tasks.

#### 2. Associative Memory — "Vitznaya card file"
This was the ** main "feature" of ** SAIL. The language allowed working with data not only by numeric indexes (as in arrays), but also by **key strings**. Today it is called **associative array** or **hash table** (in Python - `dict`, in JavaScript — `object`).

**An example in a modern manner:**
Imagine that in 1972 you could write like this:
``pascal
// Is a pseudocode that conveys the idea
of a person := record (name, age, occupation);
people := association (string, person);

people["John Doe"] := person("John Doe", 30, "Programmer");
people["Jane Smith"] := person("Jane Smith", 28, "Scientist");

print(people["John Doe"].age); // Outputs: 30
``
It was revolutionary and incredibly convenient for representing knowledge and complex data.

#### 3. Built-in multitasking support
SAIL had built-in primitives for **parallel programming** (`cobegin`, `coend`). You could easily run multiple processes at the same time. This is critically important for robotics, where you need to simultaneously read sensor data, control motors, and make plans.

#### 4. Interaction with iron
Unlike many academic languages, SAIL was "close to metal." He allowed it:
* Directly read and write to specific memory addresses.
* Work with interruptions.
* Manage external devices directly from the code.

Thanks to this, SAIL wrote programs for the first ** computer controller for a car**, controlled manipulators and robots.

#### 5. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) — decades before its time!
SAIL was running its own operating environment — **WAITS**. And he had, perhaps, the first real IDE in the world.**:
* **Built-in multi-window text editor.* Programmers could edit, compile, and debug the code without logging out.
*   **Syntax highlighting.** Yes, yes, even then! Keywords were highlighted in bold on monitors that supported bold writing.
* **Integration with the source code management system.**

It wasn't just a compiler, it was a whole "digital desktop" for the researcher.

### Legendary projects created on SAIL

*   **Brett:** A robot dog with computer vision. He could see the room through the camera, find an outlet and... plug into it to recharge. It was all written in SAIL.
* **WYSIWYG editors and publishing systems:** One of the first systems in the world to display a document on the screen exactly as it will be printed (Xerox Alto and Bravo were later). It was called the Stanford Office System.
* **Prototype hypertext system:** Years before the advent of the World Wide Web.
* **One of the first computer games is "Starship":** Text adventure game, the predecessor of the famous "Colossal Cave Adventure".
* **Automatic theorem proving and machine translation systems.**

### Legacy and why SAIL "disappeared"

SAIL flourished in the 1970s. But by the early 1980s, his star had waned. Why?

1. **Hardware binding:** SAIL was honed for mainframes **DEC PDP-10**. With the advent of new architectures (VAX, Unix workstations), migrating the entire complex SAIL ecosystem proved to be a herculean task.
2. **Competition with LISP:** LISP machines from Symbolics and other companies have become the dominant platform for AI, attracting attention and resources.
3. **The Rise of C and Unix:** The combination of the **C** language and the **Unix** operating system proved to be more portable, versatile, and eventually conquered the world. Many of SAIL's ideas (such as associative arrays) were simply reimplemented in other languages.
4. **Death of the PDP-10:** DEC stopped the development of this line of computers, which put an end to many projects, including SAIL.

### What is the legacy?

The direct descendant of SAIL is considered to be the **TeX** language, which its creator, **Donald Knuth**, wrote in SAIL. He transferred many of the ideas and principles debugged in SAIL to his famous layout system.

Moreover, many concepts that we take for granted today were first massively tested and shown in SAIL:
* Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
* Associative arrays (hash tables) as the basic structure of the language
* Active use of interactive window systems

**As a result, SAIL is not just a forgotten language. This is the most important chapter in the history of computer science, the "secret laboratory" where the technologies that defined our digital present were born and tested. It was not just a sail, but a flagship that steered a course into the uncharted waters of artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction.**
