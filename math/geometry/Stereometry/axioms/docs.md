### **The most interesting and necessary axioms of stereometry**  
**(No water, just the gist + cool examples)**  

---

### **ðŸ”¥ 1. The main axiom: "A plane can be drawn through any 3 points"**  
**But there is a caveat:**  
- If there are infinitely many points **on one straight line** â†’ planes** (like a piece of paper that can be rotated around a ruler).  
- If the points ** are not on the same straight line** â†’ there is only one plane ** (like a stool with three legs never swings).  

**Why do I need to:**  
To build 3D objects, for example, to determine the position of a table in a room by three points on the floor.

### **ðŸ”¥ 2. The axiom is a bundle: "If 2 points of a straight line lie in a plane, then the WHOLE straight line is there"**  
**Example:**  
- If two nails are driven into the board â†’ and the rope between them is also on the board.  
- If two pebbles are lying on the surface of the water â†’ and the stick between them is also on the water.  

**Why is it important:**  
It is precisely because of this axiom ** that a straight line in 3D can be defined by two points**.

## 3. The axiom of intersection: "Two planes intersect in a STRAIGHT line"**  
** What is it about:**  
- Any two planes (if they do not coincide) cut each other ** only in a straight line**.  

**Examples:**  
- Corner of the room â†’ the line of intersection of two walls.  
- If you pierce two sheets of paper with a pencil â†’ pencil and there is an intersection line.  

**Feature:**  
This axiom explains why in 3D graphics all complex shapes consist of flat faces.

### **ðŸ’¡ Bonus: The most useful consequence**  
**"ONE plane can be drawn through a straight line and a point outside it"**  
**Application:**  
- In architecture: to fix the roof (plane) on a wall (straight line) and a pillar (point).  
- In games: This is how the surfaces on which objects can be placed are determined.

### **ðŸ”§ Where is it actually used?**  
1. **3D printing** â€” so that the printer "understands" the planes of the part.  
2. **Augmented Reality** â€” to make virtual objects lie correctly on real surfaces.  
3. **Bridge construction** â€” calculation of loads on supports.  

---

### **ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion: what to remember**  
1. **3 points â†’ 1 plane** (if not on the same line).  
2. **2 points in the plane â†’ the whole straight line is there**.  
3. ** 2 planes â†’ cut in a straight line**.  

It is a **base** for everything 3D â€” from drawings to computer graphics! ðŸš€
