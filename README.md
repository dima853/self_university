# Introduction
**I'm developing a powerful** and **comprehensive** curriculum (although I think it's more of an encyclopedia) based on the best books and resources available. It is designed for in-depth study of all topics that require special attention. To consolidate each topic, I plan to use practical exercises and detailed articles (or several articles). My goal is not just mechanical memorization, but a real understanding of the material, the application of theory in practice and the creation of a solid foundation.

**This curriculum is currently under active development and refinement**. I am constantly improving it to achieve maximum efficiency and completeness of the coverage of the material.
