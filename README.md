# Introduction
This is a powerful curriculum I’ve built, leveraging the best books and resources available. It’s designed for a deep and comprehensive exploration of all topics demanding careful attention. I’ll solidify each topic with a hands-on assignment and an in-depth article (or multiple). My objective is not mere rote learning, but genuine comprehension of the material, applying theory to practice and building a rock-solid foundation
