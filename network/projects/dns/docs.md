# 1.2.2  Robustness Principle

> "Be liberal in what you accept, and
   conservative in what you send"

> Software should be written to deal with every conceivable
         error, no matter how unlikely; sooner or later a packet will
         come in with that particular combination of errors and
         attributes, and unless the software is prepared, chaos can
         ensue.
