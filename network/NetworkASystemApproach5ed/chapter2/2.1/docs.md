### [Coaxial Cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable?ysclid=majkf3rczi300781000)

Coaxial cable (or "coax") is a type of electrical cable widely used for transmitting high-frequency signals with low interference. It consists of multiple layers that help shield the signal from external noise.

## **1. Structure of Coaxial Cable**  
A coaxial cable has four main components:  

1. **Center Conductor** – A solid or stranded copper wire that carries the signal.  
2. **Dielectric Insulator** – A non-conductive layer (usually plastic) that separates the conductor from the shield.  
3. **Metallic Shield** – A braided or foil layer that blocks electromagnetic interference (EMI).  
4. **Outer Jacket** – A protective plastic coating that prevents physical damage.

## **2. Types of Coaxial Cables**  
Different types are used for specific applications:  

| **Type**       | **Impedance** | **Common Uses**                     |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **RG-6**      | 75 Ω        | Cable TV, Satellite, Broadband     |
| **RG-8**      | 50 Ω        | Radio antennas, Amateur radio      |
| **RG-58**     | 50 Ω        | Ethernet (older networks), CB radio |
| **RG-59**     | 75 Ω        | CCTV, Analog video                 |
| **LMR-400**   | 50 Ω        | High-power RF, Cellular antennas  |

## **3. Advantages of Coaxial Cable**  
✔ **Low Signal Loss** – Good for long-distance transmissions.  
✔ **High Bandwidth** – Supports high-frequency signals (up to several GHz).  
✔ **EMI Shielding** – Reduces interference from external sources.  
✔ **Durable** – Resistant to physical damage and weather conditions.  

---

## **4. Disadvantages**  
✖ **Thicker & Less Flexible** – Harder to install in tight spaces.  
✖ **More Expensive** Than UTP (Ethernet) cables.  
✖ **Limited Data Speed** – Slower than fiber optics for modern broadband.

## **5. Common Applications**  
- **TV & Internet (Cable & Satellite)**  
- **Radio & Antenna Systems**  
- **CCTV & Security Cameras**  
- **Military & Aerospace Communications**  
- **Medical Imaging Equipment**

## **6. Coaxial vs. Fiber Optic vs. Ethernet**  

| Feature        | Coaxial | Fiber Optic | Ethernet (UTP) |
|--------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Speed**    | Up to 10 Gbps | Up to 100+ Gbps | Up to 10 Gbps |
| **Distance** | ~500m | 40+ km | ~100m |
| **Interference** | Low | None | Moderate |
| **Cost** | Medium | High | Low |

## **7. Future of Coaxial Cables**  
While fiber optics are replacing coax in high-speed internet, coaxial cables remain relevant for:  
- **Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial (HFC) networks** (used by ISPs like Comcast)  
- **Legacy systems** (TV, radio, CCTV)  
- **RF & Microwave transmissions**  

### **Conclusion**  
Coaxial cables are reliable for RF signal transmission but are gradually being replaced by fiber in high-speed data networks. However, they remain essential in broadcasting, surveillance, and telecom industries.  


### The formula for calculating the wavelength in a copper cable:
$$[
\text{Wavelength} = \frac{\text{The speed of light in copper}}{\text{Frequency}} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \times 3 \times 10^8}{300}
\]$$

### Step-by-step calculation:
1. **The speed of light in copper** (~66% of the speed in vacuum):  
   $$\[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3 \times 10^8 = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
   \]$$

2. **Frequency substitution** (300 Hz):
$$[
   \frac{2 \times 10^8}{300} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10^6 \approx 667 \times 10^3 \, \text{meters}
   \]$$

### The final result:
$$\[
\boxed{667\, \text{km} \quad \text{(667,000 meters)}}
\]$$

#### Note:
- For high frequencies (e.g. 300 MHz), the wavelength will be significantly shorter.
- Signals propagate slower in copper media than in vacuum (coefficient ~2/3).
