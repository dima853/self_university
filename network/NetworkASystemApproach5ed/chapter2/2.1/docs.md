### [Coaxial Cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable?ysclid=majkf3rczi300781000)

Coaxial cable (or "coax") is a type of electrical cable widely used for transmitting high-frequency signals with low interference. It consists of multiple layers that help shield the signal from external noise.

---

## **1. Structure of Coaxial Cable**  
A coaxial cable has four main components:  

1. **Center Conductor** – A solid or stranded copper wire that carries the signal.  
2. **Dielectric Insulator** – A non-conductive layer (usually plastic) that separates the conductor from the shield.  
3. **Metallic Shield** – A braided or foil layer that blocks electromagnetic interference (EMI).  
4. **Outer Jacket** – A protective plastic coating that prevents physical damage.

## **7. Future of Coaxial Cables**  
While fiber optics are replacing coax in high-speed internet, coaxial cables remain relevant for:  
- **Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial (HFC) networks** (used by ISPs like Comcast)  
- **Legacy systems** (TV, radio, CCTV)  
- **RF & Microwave transmissions**  

### **Conclusion**  
Coaxial cables are reliable for RF signal transmission but are gradually being replaced by fiber in high-speed data networks. However, they remain essential in broadcasting, surveillance, and telecom industries.  


### The formula for calculating the wavelength in a copper cable:
$$[
\text{Wavelength} = \frac{\text{The speed of light in copper}}{\text{Frequency}} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \times 3 \times 10^8}{300}
\]$$

### Step-by-step calculation:
1. **The speed of light in copper** (~66% of the speed in vacuum):  
   $$\[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3 \times 10^8 = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
   \]$$

2. **Frequency substitution** (300 Hz):
$$[
   \frac{2 \times 10^8}{300} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10^6 \approx 667 \times 10^3 \, \text{meters}
   \]$$

### The final result:
$$\[
\boxed{667\, \text{km} \quad \text{(667,000 meters)}}
\]$$

#### Note:
- For high frequencies (e.g. 300 MHz), the wavelength will be significantly shorter.
- Signals propagate slower in copper media than in vacuum (coefficient ~2/3).
> Generally, electromagnetic waves span	a much wider range of frequencies, ranging from	radio waves, to	infrared
light, to visible light, to	x-rays and gamma rays.

transmitting — binary data (1 and 0).

**The problem of encoding binary data onto electromagnetic signals is a	complex	topic.**

# **Summary: Fundamentals of modulation and data transmission**  

#### **1. Lower level (modulation)**  
- **Modulation** is the change of signal parameters (frequency, amplitude, phase) to transmit information.  
- **Example**: Amplitude modulation (AM) is a change in signal power (analogous to turning on/off a light).  
- **Application**: Conversion of digital data into analog signals for transmission over physical media (copper wires, radio waves).  

#### **2. Upper level (data encoding)**  
- **Task**: Converting binary data (0 and 1) into distinguishable signals (for example, "high" and "low" levels).  
- **Simplification**: In the context of computer networks, modulation is considered a solved problem; the focus is on coding methods.  

#### **3. Key ideas**  
1. **Separation of layers**:
- **Bottom layer** (physical): signal modulation.  
   - **Top layer** (channel/network): encoding bits into signals.  
2. **Binary encoding**:  
   - Uses two distinguishable signal states to represent 0 and 1.  
   - Examples of methods: NRZ, Manchester coding (see the next section).  
3. **Abstraction**:  
   - For network design, the modulation is often "hidden", and the analysis is carried out at the level of discrete signals.  

#### **4. Importance for networks**  
- **Reliability**: Correct encoding minimizes transmission errors.  
- **Compatibility**: Standardized methods (for example, Ethernet) ensure the interaction of devices.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Modulation and encoding are fundamental data transmission processes. In network models, the upper layer (encoding) plays a key role, abstracting from the physical implementation of the modulation.  

For in-depth study:
- **Modulation methods**: AM, FM, PSK.  
- **Coding schemes**: NRZ, 4B/5B, Manchester code.

# **Summary: Classification of network connections by type of use**

#### **1. Main categories of network connections**
1. **Wireless Networks**
- **Where**meet: cafes, airports, universities, public places.  
   - **Features**:
- Convenience for mobile users.  
     - Limited speed and coverage area.  
     - Examples: Wi-Fi, 4G/5G.  

2. **"The Last Mile" (Last-Mile Links)**
- **Providers**: Internet services for end users (homes, offices).  
   - **Technologies**:  
     - **DSL** (uses existing copper telephone lines).  
     - **Cable Internet** (via CATV coaxial cables).  
     - **Optical Fiber (FTTH)** — High-speed connection.  
   - **Features**:
- Cost-effective for mass deployment.  
     - They are not suitable for creating backbone networks.  

3. **Backbone Links**
- **Destination**: Connecting between cities and countries.  
   - **Technologies**:
- High-speed fiber optic lines.  
     - Satellite or radio relay communications (for remote regions).  
   - **Requirements**:  
     - High bandwidth (100+ Gbps).  
     - Minimal delays.  

---

#### **2. Economic and technological factors**
- **DSL**: Cheap to deploy (uses existing telephone infrastructure), but outdated.  
- **Optical Fiber (FTTH)**: More expensive, but provides future scalability.  
- **Wireless technologies**: Low cost coverage for mobile users, but depend on the frequency spectrum.  

---

#### **3. The limitations of the "last mile"**
- **Not suitable for global networks**:  
  - Low speed compared to main lines.  
  - Local coverage (for example, DSL only works at a distance of ~5 km from the PBX).  
- **Solution**: A combination of "last mile" + high-speed highways.  

---

### **Conclusion**
Network connections are classified according to **place of use** (user vs backbone) and **economic feasibility**.  
- **For consumers**: Wireless and "last mile" (DSL, Cable, FTTH).  
- **For global networks**: Fiber optic trunks.  

**Example**: Home Wi-Fi (wireless) → DSL (last mile) → Urban Fiber (backbone).
