# 🌟 **Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)** 🌟  

**SCTP** is a transport layer protocol that combines the best features of **TCP** and **UDP**! �  
It is described in:
- 📜 **RFC 2960** ([Stewart et al., 2000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2960 ))  
- 🔄 **RFC 3309** ([Stone, Stewart, and Otis, 2002](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3309))  
- 🎓 **Introduction to SCTP** — **RFC 3286** ([Ong and Yoakum, 2002](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3286 ))

## 🔥 **Key Features of SCTP**  

### 1️⃣ **Associations instead of connections** 🤝  
Unlike TCP, where there is a **"connection"** (between two IP addresses), SCTP uses **"associations"** - this is a connection between two systems, which can include **multiple IP addresses** (due to multihoming).  

> **A real-life example:**  
> Imagine that you have two internet connections — via Wi-Fi and mobile internet. SCTP can use both at the same time for reliability! 📶📱  

---

### 2️⃣ **Message-oriented, not flow-oriented** ✉️  
- In **TCP**, data is transmitted as **a stream of bytes** (without message boundaries).  
- In **SCTP**, data is transmitted ** in separate records** (as in UDP), but with guaranteed delivery (as in TCP).  

> **Java example (using SCTP):**  
> ```java
> import com.sun.nio.sctp.*;
> 
> public class SctpServer {
>     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
>         SctpServerChannel server = SctpServerChannel.open();
>         InetSocketAddress addr = new InetSocketAddress(1234);
>         server.bind(addr);
> 
> System.out.println("The server is running and waiting for connections... 🚀");
>         SctpChannel clientChannel = server.accept();
> 
>         ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
>         clientChannel.receive(buffer, null, null);
> System.out.println("Message received: " + new String(buffer.array()).trim());
> }
> }
> ```

### 3️⃣ **Multiple streams in the same association** 🌊  
SCTP allows you to create **multiple independent streams** within a single association.  
- If a packet is lost in one stream, it ** will not block** other streams!  
- In TCP, the loss of even one packet ** stops the entire transmission** until recovery.  

> **Example:**  
> Introduce Video Call (SCTP):  
> - 🔊 **Audio** is a single stream.  
> - � **The video** is different.  
> If the video slows down, the sound will still be clear! 🎤

### 4️⃣ **Multihoming - reliability through redundancy** 🛡️  
SCTP supports **multiple IP addresses** at one end of the association.  
- If one network fails, SCTP will automatically switch to a backup.  

> **A real-life example:**  
> The server has two Internet channels - **main (optics)** and **standby (4G)**.  
> In case of optical failure, SCTP will instantly switch to 4G without disconnecting the connection! ⚡

## 🎯 **Conclusion: Why is SCTP cool?**  
✅ **TCP reliability** + **UDP flexibility**  
✅ **Does not block streams** in case of data loss  
, **Works in conditions of network failures** (multihoming)  
✅ **Ideal for VoIP, video conferencing, online gaming** �🎮
