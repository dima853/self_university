# Synopsis: An overview of the security of lower-level TCP/IP protocols

## Introduction
This section examines the protocols at the lower levels of the TCP/IP stack, focusing on their vulnerabilities and security issues. The focus is on IP, ARP and TCP.

## 2.1 Basic Protocols

### 2.1.1 IP Protocol (Internet Protocol)
- **Main function**: A packet multiplexer that adds an IP header to messages of higher-level protocols
- **Features**:
- Unreliable datagram service (no guarantees of delivery, order, uniqueness)
- Header checksum does not protect data
  - Lack of authentication of the source address (IP spoofing is possible)

**Example of IP spoofing in C**:
```c
// Example of creating a RAW socket with IP address substitution
int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW);
char packet[4096];
// Filling in the IP header with a fake source IP
struct iphdr *ip = (struct iphdr *)packet;
ip->saddr = inet_addr("192.168.1.100"); // Spoofed
ip address->daddr = inet_addr("10.0.0.1");
// ... the remaining fields
of the sendto header(sock, packet, ip->tot_len, 0, (struct sockaddr *)&dest, sizeof(dest));
```

- **Fragmentation**:
  - Packets can fragment when the MTU is exceeded
- Security issues: bypassing filters, overlapping fragments with different contents

- **IP addresses (IPv4)**:
- 32-bit, divided into network and host parts (CIDR)
- Broadcast addresses (all 0 or 1 in the host part)
- Directed broadcast traffic can be used for attacks

### 2.1.2 ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Converting IP addresses to MAC addresses for Ethernet
- **Operating mechanism**: Broadcast requests and responses with caching of results
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - ARP spoofing: spoofing ARP responses to redirect traffic
  - Lack of authentication in the protocol

**Example of ARP spoofing**:
```c
// Example of sending a fake ARP response
struct arp_packet {
    uint16_t htype; // Hardware type
    uint16_t ptype; // Protocol type
// ... other fields of the ARP header
    u_char sha[6]; // Sender's MAC (forged)
u_char spa[4]; // Sender's IP (forged)
u_char tha[6]; // Target's MAC
    u_char tpa[4]; // IP of the target
};

struct arp_packet pkt;
// Filling with fake
memcpy data(pkt.sha, attacker_mac, 6);
memcpy(pkt.spa, victim_ip, 4);
// ...
send_packet(&pkt);
```

### 2.1.3 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Main function**: Providing a reliable duplex connection over an unreliable IP
- **Mechanisms**:
- Sequential numbers for ordering and confirmation
  - Overload control and retransmission

#### Establishing a connection (Three-way handshake)
1. Client → Server: SYN (ISNc)
2. Server → Client: SYN-ACK (iSNS, ACK(ISNc+1))
3. Client → Server: ACK(iSNS+1)

**Example in C**:
```c
// Simplified example of TCP handshake
int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;
serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
serv_addr.sin_port = htons(80);
inet_pton(AF_INET, "192.168.1.1", &serv_addr.sin_addr);

// SYN
connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
// The kernel completes the handshake automatically
```

#### TCP vulnerabilities:
1. **SYN flood**: Sending multiple SYNs without completing the handshake
   - Filling the queue of half-open connections
   - Solution: SYN cookies

2. **The ISN predictability attack**:
- If the initial sequence number (ISN) is predictable, spoofing is possible
   - Solution: Cryptographically strong ISN generation (RFC 1948)

**Visualization of ISN**:
- Good implementation: diffuse point cloud (FreeBSD 4.6)
- Poor implementations: clear patterns (Windows NT 4.0, IRIX 6.5)

3. **Privileged ports (1-1024)**:
- On UNIX, only root can open
- Unreliable authentication scheme, as it is not universal

#### Closing the connection
- An asymmetric process (each side closes independently)
- FIN packages for initiating closure

## Safety conclusions
1. IP layer:
   - There is no source authentication
   - Possible spoofing and fragmentation attacks

2. ARP:
- Vulnerable to spoofing
   - Solutions: Static ARP, ARP inspection

3. TCP:
- Vulnerable to spoofing with predictable ISN
- SYN-flooding can cause DoS
   - Privileged ports are an unreliable authentication mechanism

**Recommendations**:
- Use cryptographic authentication methods (do not rely on IP/TCP mechanisms)
- Configure filtering of directed broadcast traffic
- Implement protection against SYN flood
- Ensure correct ISN generation (RFC 1948)
