but an early entry into the diseasespan is often
 a sign that your cells are aging.

 And studies show that people who feel
 older than their biological age also tend to be sicker earlier than people
 who feel younger (not placebo)

 But really, aging doesn’t have to be so traumatic.

 If your answers to our three questions suggest that you look and feel
 older than your age, perhaps it’s because your telomeres are wearing
 down faster than they should.

 Those short telomeres could be sending
 your cells a signal that it’s time to fast-forward the aging process.

 There’s plenty you can do to fight
 premature aging where it counts the most: at the cellular level.
