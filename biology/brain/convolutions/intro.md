Convolutions and furrows are folds on the surface of the cerebral cortex. They give the brain its characteristic appearance and play an important role in its functioning, affecting intelligence, cognitive abilities and other aspects.

** Why do we need convolutions and furrows?**

* **Increased surface area:* The cerebral cortex is a thin layer of gray matter containing neurons (nerve cells). Folds (convolutions and furrows) allow you to increase the surface area of the cerebral cortex without increasing the total volume of the skull. A larger surface area means more neurons and more synaptic connections (connections between neurons).
* **Organization of functions:** Convolutions and furrows are not just random folds. They serve as landmarks separating different areas of the brain responsible for different functions. For example, the central sulcus separates the motor cortex (movement control) from the somatosensory cortex (sensory information processing).
* **Reduced signal transmission time:* It is believed that folds can reduce the distance between neural networks, facilitating and speeding up the transfer of information between them.

** How do convolutions affect intelligence and cognitive abilities?**

* **More complex information processing:** The greater number of neurons and synaptic connections provided by the gyri allows the brain to process information more efficiently, solve complex tasks, and adapt to new situations. This is due to higher intelligence and better cognitive abilities.
*   **Increased neural plasticity:* A brain with more convolutions may be more plastic, that is, capable of change and adaptation in response to experience. This allows the brain to learn better, remember information, and recover from damage.
* **More efficient organization of functions:** The clear separation of functions between different brain regions provided by the gyri allows the brain to coordinate various processes such as perception, thinking, memory, and movement more effectively.

**Research:**

* Studies using neuroimaging techniques such as MRI have shown that there is a link between the complexity of the cerebral cortex convolutions and intelligence. People with a more complex gyrus structure tend to have higher intelligence.
* Animal studies have also shown that an enriched environment that stimulates the brain can lead to an increase in the number of gyri and improved cognitive abilities.

**Important nuances:**

* **The structure of the gyri is not the only factor:* Intelligence and cognitive abilities depend on a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, education, experience, and lifestyle. The structure of the gyri is just one of the factors influencing these abilities.
* **It is not only the quantity that is important, but also the organization:** Not only the number of convolutions matters, but also their organization, shape, and location. Different areas of the brain with different gyrus structures are responsible for different functions.
* **Brain plasticity:** The structure of the gyri is not static. It can change over the course of a lifetime under the influence of experience and learning.

**In conclusion:**

The convolutions and furrows of the cerebral cortex play an important role in providing cognitive functions and intelligence. They increase the surface area of the cortex, separate different areas of the brain, and can contribute to more efficient information processing and neural plasticity. Although the structure of the gyri is not the only determinant of intelligence, it is an important component contributing to complex brain function.
