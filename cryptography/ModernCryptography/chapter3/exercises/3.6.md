# 3.6
**Complete proof for problem 3.6 (Katz-Lindell, 3rd ed.)**

**Condition:**
Let G: {0,1}ⁿ → {0,1}ˡ⁽ⁿ⁾ be a pseudorandom generator (PRG) with l(n) > n. Define G'(s) = G(𝑠), where 𝑠 is the bitwise complement of s. Prove that G' is also a PRG.

**Proof:**

1. **Length extension check:**
- For any s ∈ {0,1}ⁿ: |G'(s)| = |G(𝑠)| = l(n) > n
- The length extension condition is satisfied

2. **Proof of pseudorandomness:**
   Assume the opposite - let G' not be a PRG. Then there exists a polynomial discriminator D' and a polynomial p(·) such that for infinitely many n:

   |Pr[D'(G'(s)) = 1] - Pr[D'(r) = 1]| > 1/p(n)   (1)

   where s ← {0,1}ⁿ, r ← {0,1}ˡ⁽ⁿ⁾.

3. **Let's build a distinguisher D for G:**
   Define D(y) as follows:
- Get y ∈ {0,1}ˡ⁽ⁿ⁾ (this is either G(s) or a random r)
- Return D'(y)

4. **Advantage analysis D:**
   Consider two cases:

   a) If y = G(s) for a random s:
   Pr[D(G(s)) = 1] = Pr[D'(G(s)) = 1]
   But G(s) = G'(𝑠), since 𝑠 = s
   = Pr[D'(G'(𝑠̅)) = 1]

   b) If y is a random r:
   Pr[D(r) = 1] = Pr[D'(r) = 1]

   Thus, the advantage of D:
   |Pr[D(G(s)) = 1] - Pr[D(r) = 1]|
   = |Pr[D'(G'(𝑠̅)) = 1] - Pr[D'(r) = 1]| > 1/p(n)

   But 𝑠 is uniformly distributed over {0,1}ⁿ when s is uniform.

5. **The contradiction:**
   We found that D distinguishes G(s) from random with an advantage of > 1/p(n), which contradicts the fact that G is a PRG.

6. **Conclusion:**
   Our initial assumption is incorrect - G' is indeed a PRG.

**Explanations of key points:**

1. The bitwise complement of 𝑠 preserves the uniformity of the distribution, since it is a bijection on {0,1}ⁿ.

2. It is important that l(n) > n is critical for determining PRG (otherwise the trivial "extension" G(s) = s would satisfy the condition).

3. The Distinguisher D for G is constructed directly through D' without additional transformations, since G(s) = G'(𝑠).

4. Step 4 uses the fact that for uniform s, 𝑠 is also uniform, so Pr[D'(G'(𝑠)) = 1] = Pr[D'(G'(s)) = 1].

This proof demonstrates the standard reduction technique by showing that any attack on G' can be transformed into an attack on G.
