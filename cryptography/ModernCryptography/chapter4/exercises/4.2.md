Assume secure MACs exist. Give a construction of a MAC that is secure
 with respect to Definition 4.2 but that is not secure when the adversary
 is additionally given access to a Vrfy oracle (cf. the previous exercise).

def 4.2 
MAC П = (gen. mac, vrfy) 
is existentially unforgeable under an adaptive chosen-message attack, or just secure, if for all PPT adversaries A , there is a negligible fucntion negl such that: 
Pr[Mac-forge A,П(n) = 1] <= negl(n)
