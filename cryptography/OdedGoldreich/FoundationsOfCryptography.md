### **Key Features of Goldreich’s Work**  
1. **Theoretical Rigor**:  
   - Formal definitions (e.g., semantic security as a game between challenger/adversary).  
   - Proofs via reduction to complexity assumptions (e.g., "If PRGs exist, then P≠NP").  

2. **Foundational Focus**:  
   - Volume 1 covers **primitives** (OWFs, PRGs, ZK).  
   - Volume 2 builds **applications** (encryption, signatures, MPC).  

3. **Canonical Constructions**:  
   - Goldwasser-Micali encryption (first CPA-secure PKE).  
   - Levin’s universal OWF (Theorem 2.3.2).

### **How to Integrate This into Your Program**  
1. **For Mathematical Depth**:  
   - Assign proofs (e.g., "Show that PRGs imply OWFs").  
   - Use **interactive theorem provers** (e.g., Coq) to formalize constructions.  

2. **For Modern Relevance**:  
   - Contrast Goldreich’s ZK proofs with **zk-SNARKs** (used in Zcash).  
   - Relate OWFs to **post-quantum candidates** (Lattice-based OWFs).  

3. **Advanced Projects**:  
   - *"Implement the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) encryption scheme"*.  
   - *"Prove that Blum-Blum-Shub is a PRG under the quadratic residuosity assumption"*.

### **Missing Pieces to Supplement**  
- **Concrete Security**: Add Dan Boneh’s "Graduate Course in Applied Crypto" for real-world parameters.  
- **Post-Quantum**: Include Peikert’s "A Decade of Lattice Cryptography".  

This material will **elevate your program** to a **PhD-level understanding**. Which volume’s topics align with your current focus?
